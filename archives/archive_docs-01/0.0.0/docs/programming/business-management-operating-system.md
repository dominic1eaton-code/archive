Building a Business Operating System for your Company - Tettra
A Business Operating System (BOS) focuses on the practical execution of business processes and routines, while a Business Management System (BMS) is a broader framework that encompasses strategic planning, policy implementation, and overall organizational direction. The BOS acts as the engine for the BMS, translating strategic goals into operational actions. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Business Operating System (BOS):

    Focus:
    The day-to-day operations and execution of a business. 

Purpose:
To define and standardize internal processes, ensuring consistency and efficiency in how the business operates. 
Examples:
Documenting internal processes, managing meetings and communications, and implementing standard workflows. 
Key Features:

    Standardized processes and procedures. 

Clear communication and collaboration channels. 
Tools for tracking progress and performance. 
A framework for managing issues and resolving problems. 

Relationship to BMS:
The BOS is the operational arm of the BMS, putting the strategies and policies into action. 

Business Management System (BMS):

    Focus:
    Strategic planning, policy implementation, and overall organizational direction. 

Purpose:
To provide a comprehensive framework for managing and improving all aspects of a business, including its operations, finances, and human resources. 
Examples:
Developing business plans and strategies, implementing financial controls, and managing human resources. 
Key Features:

    Clear vision, mission, and values. 

Defined roles and responsibilities. 
Regular performance reviews and feedback. 
A framework for continuous improvement. 

Relationship to BOS:
The BMS provides the overall framework and direction, while the BOS ensures that the strategies are effectively implemented and executed. 

In essence: The BMS is the "what" and "why" of the business, while the BOS is the "how". The BMS sets the goals and direction, and the BOS provides the tools and processes to achieve those goals.

An "enterprise operating system" can refer to two different concepts: the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) or a system that manages enterprise resources and operations. EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System) is a business framework that helps companies clarify, simplify, and achieve their vision. It focuses on areas like vision, traction, and healthy leadership. The other concept refers to a system that dynamically allocates resources to required activities within an enterprise. Examples include Linux and Windows Server. 
1. Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS):

    Definition:
    EOS is a framework and set of tools that help businesses, particularly entrepreneurial ones, organize their operations, improve leadership, and achieve their goals. 

Key Areas:
EOS focuses on three main areas:

    Vision: Ensuring everyone in the organization is aligned on the company's goals and how to achieve them. 

Traction: Instilling focus, discipline, and accountability to execute on the vision. 
Healthy: Helping leadership teams become more cohesive and functional. 

Tools and Concepts:
EOS uses a variety of tools and concepts to achieve these goals, including structured meetings (Level 10 Meetings), goal setting, and issue tracking. 
Benefits:
By implementing EOS, businesses can improve communication, alignment, accountability, and overall performance. 

2. Enterprise Operating System (E-OS) as a System:

    Definition:
    This refers to a system that manages and coordinates various aspects of an enterprise's operations, often with a focus on resource allocation and dynamic adaptation. 

Functionality:
An E-OS can monitor enterprise resources, dynamically allocate them to required activities, and ensure that different parts of the enterprise work together effectively. 
Examples:

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux: Red Hat provides a Linux-based operating system for enterprise use [17].
    Windows Server: Microsoft offers Windows Server operating systems for managing enterprise networks and applications [2]. 

Purpose:
The goal of an E-OS is to create a self-governing, intelligent, and viable enterprise entity.

We need constructs to better model enterprises self governing system, by modeling enteprises as self-observing systems and not merely as observed systems. We introduce the concept of Enterprise Operating System (EOS), as the emerging enterprise self governing system, which turns enterprises into autonomous, intelligent and viable entities. Our assumption is that all organizations, evolve to higher complex levels, whereby at some point “organizational autonomous life” emerges as a reification, at a macro systemic level, of the social-technical network of its autonomous agents. This reification is precisely realized by the emergence of the EOS, enabling the enterpise closure, characterized by its completeness and self-reference, and the preservation of its wholeness and distinctiveness. The EOS should be able to compile in near real time its position and trajectory to assess if is in line with its viable states set and trigger/call for correction actions and self transformations whenever needed. Our research goal is to develop a universal EOS (UEOS) model to design, diagnose and improve the EOS of any organization, by certifying that its particular EOS includes all of the UEOS´s required mechanisms and properties.
