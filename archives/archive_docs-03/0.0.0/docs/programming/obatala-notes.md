Self-healing networks are automated systems that can detect and resolve network issues without human intervention. They leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to monitor the network, identify anomalies, and automatically apply fixes. This allows for continuous network operation and reduces downtime, ultimately leading to improved reliability and security. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Key Features and Benefits:

    Automation:
    . 

Self-healing networks automate tasks like monitoring, diagnosis, and remediation, reducing the need for human intervention. 
Real-time Monitoring:
.
They continuously monitor network performance and identify potential issues before they impact users. 
Proactive Problem Solving:
.
They can predict and prevent network problems, minimizing the impact of failures. 
Enhanced Security:
.
Self-healing networks can detect and isolate security threats, preventing them from spreading. 
Improved Reliability:
.
By automatically resolving issues, these networks ensure consistent connectivity and application performance. 
Reduced Downtime:
.
Automated recovery processes eliminate delays associated with human intervention, minimizing downtime. 

How they work:

    1. Monitoring and Data Collection:
    . 

Self-healing networks use various sensors and monitoring tools to collect data on network performance and identify anomalies. 
2. AI and ML Analysis:
.
Machine learning algorithms analyze the collected data to identify patterns and predict potential problems. 
3. Automated Remediation:
.
When a problem is detected, the network automatically initiates the appropriate corrective action, such as rerouting traffic, restarting a failed component, or applying a software patch. 
4. Continuous Learning:
.
The network learns from its experiences and continuously improves its ability to predict and prevent future problems.
