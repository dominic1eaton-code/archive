general agent system
- limit of architecture/design, process from communication entropy/interaction between multiple agents
- agent boundary, agent boundary communication/interaction entropy (cost) and agent replication (structure generation)
- enterprise org chart/architecture matches/homomorphic to produced solution/product design
- low cost within boundaries, high cost outside of boundaries, agent boundary information communication (memetics) cost

observation
- design from previous org chart in all current/future org charts (markov chain, random process) as org chart evolves with evolving product
    - creation of new org with new product, no history, provenance removal
    - org chart superposition principle
    - org system scale, dimensions
        - temporal scale, dimension
        - spatial scale, dimension
- infinite cost between agent boundary on temporal dimension (no time travel communication)
