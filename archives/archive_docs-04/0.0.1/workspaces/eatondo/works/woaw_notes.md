# story notes
exploration of the challenges faced by black women as they enter into formal/corporate/white american work spaces, from microagressions, outright racial agressions, code switching, being "black whisperers" or black culture gurus for those who are not in the know, as well as feeling the pressure of having to continuously prove themselves and demonstrate their value to others. Also a look into the various mental,emotional and physical changes, with the most salient physical modification being that of hair, that black women undergo as they move, navigate and assimilate into these types of workspaces, with further exploration into how one's work occupation becomes ones identity, and how when one begins to take on and become a corporate identity persona character they slowly begin to lose pieces of their cultural identity in the process and begin distancing themselves from their community; with black women facing a balancing act of trying not to lose themselves but also trying to take on these "mask" identites in order to survive in workplaces that may not always be hospitable to their natures. 


# scene notes
- opening scenes with camera to back of characters head, with their hair in full focus view, with the hair styles changing and evolving with each era and work environment
    - opening scene in era I at late 1930s train station, filled with women waiting to board; camera is set fixed wide out as to show full train pulling into station. Caroleena's face is not visible, just her hair (initially ida b wells style) can be scene. Doors to train open and women begin to board as they head into the city for work; camera is at Caroleenas back, showing her hair in full visible focus, as she moves onto the train and takes her seat, camera remaining on her hair. 
    - opening scene era II at mid 1980s subway train station, camera to back of Diana, with straightened hair in full focused view.

final scene season IV:
    camera has had back to Hazel, with her locks adorned with gold in full view the entirity of the episode, interleaved with cutscenes to the fallout and concluding after events from previous episode and resolutions of the series. In final scene, a young, bright eyed, smiling Nella walks into her cubicle with excitement, slight nervousness, uncertainty, slight naivity, but grateful joy. as she places her things down on her desk, she takes notice and is surprised to see another young women nearby (Hazel), which bring a bit of her nervourness to rest as she feels a bit better at having a possible ally in an unknown environment. Nella, hoping to make a name for herself in her new role, but also feeling some of the pressures and burdens of the role as well, takes a seat at her desk and makes the first eye contact with Hazel. They exchange words of kindred spirits and this makes Nella feel reassured. As finaly introduction words between the two of them are exchanged the camera slowly begins to turn around from being at hazels back to slowly reveal her face. Nella says her name and when the camera has completely turned around, fully revealing Hazels face, Hazel has a large, welcoming, warm, cunning, slightly nefarious smile, and says her name "Im Hazel", after which the scene immediately cuts to black and the tripple thud sound effect from the original series is played.
