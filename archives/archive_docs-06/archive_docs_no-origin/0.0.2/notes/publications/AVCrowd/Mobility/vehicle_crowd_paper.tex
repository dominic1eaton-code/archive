\textbf{Vehicle Behavior and Response Study:} \\


Studying the effects of collective vehicle traffic behavioral responses to various perturbations the shared environment of limited resources. \\

Study the strength of interaction, correlation, and information sharing/passing between different entities that exist within a traffic network and persist on roadways. \\

Study methods for optimal formation control of vehicle groups, using results obtained from observed behavioral responses (local and collective (global)) \\

Study methods for \\ 
1. Control strategies for AVs to from desirable collective vehicle traffic behaviors / responses to environment. \\
2. Using AVs to control non-controllable traffic, \\
A. How many AVs needed to achieve desirable collective response ?, \\
B. How can AVs affect the behaviors of agents (humans) around them ? \\
C. How can Avs change / optimize local state to achieve desired global state ?  \\

\textbf{Multi Agent Formation Control:} \\ 

Study global control techniques through the control of local vehicles : \\
1. Local CAV microscopic state, control laws, parameters, etc... needed for analysis (and solution.) ? \\ 

2. Global vehicle (platoon) macroscopic state, control laws, parameters, etc... needed for analysis (and solution.) ? \\

Achieve stability and consensus and explore methods that achieve these characteristics in a reasonable time. \\

Obtain and maintain vehicle group rigidity and interaction strength (quantify interaction strength, correlation, variability) \\

Study collective vehicle traffic response to environment and explore response control techqniques - (DMPC, Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) \\

\textbf{Communications/Information System:} \\

Generating, Collecting, Maintaining, and Sharing information/data of collective vehicle system \\
