so yes I have heard all of the stories. Have heard all of the tales of greatness the permeated the halls of a history long passed. And here
we are today, still living in the echoes reverberating from these same halls. If I could have foreseen the small moments, maybe all of the other 
maybes would have come to pass. 

Evening along the shore 
The children gathered along the western banks, near tall grass the gently swayed in the soft breeze. The verdant banks served as refuge for the playing youth,
as they made their way across the shore. unbridled laughter and joyous delight flowed along with the breeze and filled the air all along the shore. The fathers 
were up along the dunes, were the greenery merged into a mix of loose soil, flowers, and sparse coverings of bushes. The sun had begun its descent, and vibrant oranges, 
reds and violets were intermingled within the blueness of the clear sky. Striafied clouds could be seen way up in the heavens caressing the rainbow of colors that painted
the warming sky. These were the evenings of camarederie, of pristine beautitude. The laughter of fathers playfully wisping and winding along with that of the children.
