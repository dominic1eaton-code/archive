So I refined the initial concept art  (I will probably do this several times over the next few weeks). 

I am now kind of liking the idea of having the four team members being Bots themselves that are being trained by the AI to eliminate the humans. The bots have the ability to manipulate matter and (with the help of their suit) can channel matter from the environment around them to morph their bodies into weapons (and other tool items I suppose). 

A bigger story idea that I was thinking about is that this could be like a two part series, where the first part is from the perspective of the humans who are attempting to destroy the AI core (and keeping the same story elements that we talked about previously). The second part would be from the perspective of four bots who are in parallel moving through the facility with the humans and are (with some influence / direction from the central AI) developing and learning from those humans, and are learning to refine themselves to be beings superior to the humans that they are encountering. Of course there are many more points to consider and think about from this idea, but this is just a start to have something to think about.
