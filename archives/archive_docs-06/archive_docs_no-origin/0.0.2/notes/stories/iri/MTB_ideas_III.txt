Humanity (or some 'intelligent' species) has now began growing 'organic bot entities' inside of seeds placed within asteroids orbiting a considerable distance away from any major civilization location. 'Grown' bots are created for specialized (or general) purposes. Decentralized "AI Cores" that coordinate with one another are responsible for automated development and overseeing seed growth and development.

Seeds sent to asteroids for the purpose of growth and development of "specialized" bots, vs. generic "service" bots, Decentralized AI cores, and "humanoid" species directors / leaders / managements. Technoglogy used to implant seeds in asteroids can harvest inorganic asteroid matter (asteroid composition...) and manipulate / meld [bio-]organic and inorganic matter for the creation of "special bots" 


Special bots
- prostheses limbs / "temp" bodies 
- stem cells 
- higher / highly functioning bots 
- bio-organic technology creation ("living" ships / guns / applicaiances / electronics ...)

MTB Beginning Cenimatic scene [v.II]:
Beta-2 fighting way accross asteroid landscape to gain entry into seed that seems to be emerging from inside the asteroid's core to the surface. Beta-2 carries along four pods (containing player character team), and seems to have mission of 'breaking' into the emerging seed where player character team has a tactical mission. Beta-2 enters seed through 'orifice'(which closes upon entry). Mission directives and objectives are displayed on player character teams' HUDs (Destroy AI core; Stay together). Beta-2 outfits team with gear, then goes off to complete separate mission.
