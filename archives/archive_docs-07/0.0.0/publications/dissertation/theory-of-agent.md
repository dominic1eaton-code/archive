# notes
- perception as a mechanism of change, state changing transformation,morphism
    - the lens of observability; noumena
- necessity of perception of agent to realize system
- system coherence vs entropy
    - system organization vs chaos
    - system stability, convergence vs divergence
- system mechanics, interactions, mechanism of change/exchange
- system energy,thermodynamics,data+information+communication+interaction dynamics, memetics
- system boundary, agent boundary
- agent/system transforms,equivalance, system representation
