the fundamental law of distinction
- the ability of "agent" to be distinguished from that of "not agent"
- existence
	- base instance of the law of distinction
	- the fundamental distinction
	


the fundamental principle of duality
	-  the "question;answer" pair
	-  the "agent; non agent" pair
		- agent; environment
		- system; individual
