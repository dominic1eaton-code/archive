	- why does this process occur ?, is this process necessary ?, can an [any] agent 
      replicate this process ?	
	
	toward [computational] trust
	- internal model produced by an agent about the expected output [model] of another agent
	  matches (directly) to the output [model] produced by that (other) agent, and correlatability
	  between two outputs (of agent internal model of other agent, and other agent output 
	  model) exists (is possible [bounds/existence of correlatability...]) 
	- consistent abidence / unmodification from the expectation (of [output, behavioral] model)
	- abstract notion of the generation of trust, based on the consistent unmodification 
	  (absence of deviancy) of behavior from expectation (of output) 
	  vs
	- preconcieved [practiced?] notion of trust, based on (historocity) and capability to achieve expectation
	  (of output model)
