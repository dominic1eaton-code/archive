{\bf Overview}

The subtle intricacies involved in the creation of effective autonomous vehicle systems currently exist on the precipice of human comprehension. Humanity has yet to fully understand all of the effects of having a collective autonomous vehicles actuating and altering our physical environment, and so a question remains of what it means to have many AVs existing in our world and how can we leverage this new found technological solution to the maximum of its abilities.

\noindent
{\bf Intellectual Merit}

The question that this research hopes to answer is how can one efficiently utilize the (soon to be) advent of the autonomous vehicle collective to solve the problem of limited human mobility and sharing of vehicular resources.
