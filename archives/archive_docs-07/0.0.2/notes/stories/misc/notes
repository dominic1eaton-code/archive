- seperation of work from the machine [Actor]
- rules describing Actor (Agent) state space and all possible permutations given some initial state

- the question of control

Valerism, Pirkowski
- increase wealth 
- increase stability
- promote equality 


- consideration of an entire entity
	- distringuishing ocmplex from non-complex agents
	- establishment of a boundary, for all agents
	- determine requirements and mechanisms for persistence of agent (an agent as defined within given boundary)
	- possible metric of complexity through requirements/mechanisms of persistence for agent in boundary
	- *metric of agent complexity through levels of volition (how influenced agent is by external vs internal 'forces', within defined boundary)
