objectives:

1. bridge the gap and move from the abstraction of the mungoni-ic agent to the concretion of the software defined agent (using systemics, systemology, mungu theory), forming the basis of a fundamental digital twin dualon(ic pair), dubbed "dijdualon", in effect providing a theoretical basis of/for the dijdualon


which by extension would mean:
1. Defining and comprehensively characterising the mungoni-ic agent (of existence)

2. the creation of a softare defined system that is the digital twin of the mungoni (the fundamental meta-system of existence)

3. the creation of software defined entites that are digital twins of entites of physical and metaphysical existence

4. the creation of the software defined agent that is the digital twin of the agent of physical and metaphysical existence

with the implied assumption that mungoni-ic existence contains the subset "physical existence" and "meta-physical existence"
