on the existence, necessary and sufficient conditions, consttrains and assumptions of mungu theory


on the implications of mungu theory, systemology and systemics


on the applications of mungu theory, systemology and systemics



use cases of mungu theory, systemology and systemics



on the nature of the mungoni, the mungon and the fundamental system


the study of ownership and stewardship, using systemics


the mungoni, the mungon, the monon, the monad, existence and non*existence, and the law of excluding middle (in correspondence with kantian noumena+pheonmena and godel incompleteness theorems)


if an agent exists that is capable of perceiving unity, and expressing the perception, must there exist a "language" that manifests that expression (i.e. must there exist necessary and sufficient conditions for mungu theory to exist, and what are those necessary and sufficient conditions for existence?)





an example:
entities gathered in an environment/space where one entity "primus" has an opposing idea (e.g. how the word "diaspora is pronounced") in contraasting comparison to the other entities in this given space, there exists a social proof hierarchical structure and order among these entities, and the primus offers a pronouncatoin that counters a preexisting established condition of the idea (primus pronounces the word in a way that is considered "wrong" by the other entities), however the primus pronounciation appears to be consistent with other ideas/words of that word's/idea's "class", potentially implying that the established doctrine imposed by the other entites (with perhaps greater implied/assumed "social proof") are inconsistent with the word class system (i.e the pronunciation of diaspora appears to be inconsistent with other "dia" words including diaphram, diatonic, diastolic, diagram, etc...), leading an observiation/questioning/externel entitty (entity ego "to represent myself as the entity "observing" and "questioning" this phenomenon/phenomena) to "posit" and query the "reasons" and "mechanisms"/morphisms/ramani by which social proof, power dynamics and established doctrines interplay within (complex/social) systems and "questioning" the nature of potential dualonic structures within this "observed" system "under" study. Dualonic power structure between primus and the opposing entities, the dualonic pronunciation of the word diaspora and its (in)consistency with other words of its class
* the use of systemics to describe and study these dualonic structures and fundamental system (the system form/structure and interactions)
