notes 
- ability to reach state of persisted equilbrium
	- able to reach state of ocnitnue growth from equilibrious state
	- able to achieve state of persited equilibrium through "programmability" (of [feedback] cycle control loop) of internal state
		- on the necesity of programmable [internal] state 
- the obligation of reciprocity
