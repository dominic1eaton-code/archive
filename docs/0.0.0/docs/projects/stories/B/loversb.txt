lovers crossed:
business was done. They sat there on the softness of the bed, holding one another in a gentle embrace... 
He looked up at me with those eyes saying "So what scares you the most then?" half smirk on his face and small 
side laugh, as if he already knew what my response would inevitably be. "The thought that I'd actually be satisfied one day, 
like then there would be nothing left for me to fight for. Now that is a thought that haunts me at night". 


"I had but one wish that you could make me whole, again, "


- 
and so like now I ma just trying to figure it all out. Like what do I do with this? Where do I put these feelings. 
Clearly they cant all just be kept inside, held hostage in the confines of my own daze. There must be  release at some point 
no? I had the feeling of abandonment before, with some of those that came before this new one. It never seems to get easier though 
yet still I continue to sludge forward, drudging through the mist and molasses clinging to a hope that seems to make me feel that 
I am only kept in chains. 

its like as if my life truly did not begin until he arrived in it, and now I dont want it any other way except with him, and thats tough, I know, 
to maintain this sense of equinimaity, a faith of a true believer, thinking that there will certainly be a day where this all works out for the best. 
This is what is held on too, what we must cling to in those most vulnerable moments
