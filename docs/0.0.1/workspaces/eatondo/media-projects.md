    * story of a young man J, who is an attractive young male who aimlessly drifiting through life, as he goes through ups and downs in the various complex relationships he holds with a myriad of women, as he undergoes an emotional awakening. He floats between various jobs and occupations as well as women who come in and out of his life, modern urban setting. The story progresses from J who begins as a charming, emotionally manipulative individual, who uses women to further his fleeting agendas and momentary desires, as he attempt to cope with self doubt via his variety of business ventures, which often times do not take off in the wild success that he secretly hopes for. He has a tendency to mask his vulnerabilities and insecurities and also tends to be clumsy in his dealings with women, as he desires to constantly project "manliness" in the form of sexual prowress and conquest of females. He can be disconnected from his deeper emotions at times which also causes him to struggle with forming deeper connections with various people in his life. Over time, he slowly achieves an emotional and spiritual awakening, gains clarity, focus and discipline, and slowly learns to have healthy and sustainable relationships which also allows him to develop into a loving and nurturing father to his daughter by the end of the story, and also allows him to run a successful business venture.
    
    He be charming, a bit manipulative at times, exude sex appeal, and yet does not always feel confidence in certain ventures and paths he takes in life. The story tells of the complex relationships he has with various women throughout his life and journey of development he goes through, from becoming a man who relies on odd jobs, sex, charm and women to attempt to fulfill his needs and fill his emptiness/restleness to a man who matures into a person with a more acute emotional awareness and eventual father of happy, loved and well adjusted daughter.
    
    He develops complicated relationships with various women in his life, where the women support him in various ways and directly contribute to his survival. He uses his physical attractiveness, charm, seductive allure and sex as tools for survival. He struggles with emotional maturity, various negative experiences from his childhood, and several failed business ventures that erode his confidence and leads him to feel as if he must rely on his beauty and ability to attract a variety of women as means to sustain himself. He eventually meets a woman where he attempts domesticity, but struggles to maintain the lifestyle, though he begins to care deeply for the woman. He goes through various ups and downs in his life journey, homelessness, male prostitution, and other struggles. Eventually he and the woman he loves decide to end the relationship.

    J has a habit of using women and poisoning several of his relatinships, behaviours which also pour into his business life and contributes to his entreprenuerial failures. As he becomes less sociopathic and more intune with his own emotions, his relationship with the closest people in his life improves and the businesses that he finally settles on begin to succeed as well throughout the coures of the story.
    
    Years go by and eventually J has a daughter, has achieved a stable lifestyle with a successful business, and has embraced an emotional disposition that allows him to be a loving single father and become a person aware/intune of the emotions of others as well as himself. story concludes with W and J having a final encounter, while J has his daughter in his arms, and they share an intimate and reminiscent moment of the love that had passed between them. W speaks on her current parent which she has a very loving and gentle relationship with, and J speaks on the joys of fatherhood. Afterward the encounter, they part ways, each taking a moment to remember where they have been, how they shaped eachother, and the people they have become in the present, and they go their seperate ways, likely to never see one another again, still melancholic on the things they had lost along their life journeys but content with the way their lives have ultimately turned out.

    Milan
    engages in sexual relationship with J, but objectifies him and treats him like an accessory to be bought and paid for. J initially enjoys the relationship but slowly begins to resent the way Milan looks down on him as she does not tend to take him seriously. Ms treatment of J causes him to further lose self esteem and confidence in his abilities that lie outside of his physique. M can tear down J a bit, and was most evident when he presented her with a possible business proposition, and her handling of the situation caused a long lasting rift between M and J.

    W
    the woman J begins to feel the possibility of sustainable love with. They form a deep connection, but differences in how they see their lives moving causes a rift in the relationship. W becomes the most stable relationship J encounters, as W is a well adjusted women and is confident and sure of her value and worth. She desires to support J where she can, and they each reveal vulnerabilities to one another in ways that they have mutually never experienced in any other relationship (romantice,familial,friend,otherwise) before. W and J siginificantly impact each other, and it is through their relationship thlat they both begin to gain insight into the things that they want for themselves and their futures, and each begins to reach a level of self awareness that they had not held before. This growth in themselves however, begins to show the differences between them and the reality that they actually do not want the same things in life, and even though they achieved a love and level of vulnerability that they have never had with any relationship previously in their life, they ultimately did not share the same future with one another and their relationship falls apart dramatically as a result. They battle to stay together becuase of the love, the self awareness they have each achieved causes them to reevaluate the things they wnat and renegotiate the types of relationships they wish to have in their lives. The relationship between W and J is tumultuous, with highs and lows as they deal with these differences between them and their own personal desires as well as the desire to be in one anothers lives.os

J uses T to advance his own interests which causes their relationship to severely sour over time, where J keeps T just interested enough to have her come back to him in his time of need, but never quite interested to the point of them having a fully realized relationship. Ts own pain contributes to the continued toxic relationship where she desperately desires him fulfill her needs, even though J seems unable to do so, and they have difficulty maintaining a healthy equilibrium within their relationship.
