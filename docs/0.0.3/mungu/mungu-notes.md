the implication of the realitonic and domainonic, realmonic

the implications of everything (reality, domain, realm, the nyumba, monad, monon, mungon, etc...) being a system and mungu theory being the theory of the mungo metaprimitive mungon(ic) system of systems, mungu theory then being the theoreitcal foundation of systemology the study of systems


the implications of the fundamental (mungonic) program, process, cycle, recursion

the implication of

The implication of **all primitives in the Mungon having an associated K-system** is profound. It creates a **systematic, organized framework** for **Mungu Theory**, where each primitive exists within a structured system that defines how it behaves, interacts, and evolves. This ensures that all elements of **Mungu Theory**—from basic primitives to complex systems—are governed by consistent principles and rules. The **K-system** acts as the organizing force that maintains coherence across different systems and enables the **emergence of complex structures** and behaviors.



mungu theory as the study of the mungoni, the fundamental meta (primitive) system that describes (form) and governs (flow) all system


theorems:
theorem of clevity and the cleave state

thoerom associating associating all Syntoni to all S-systems to all mungonic primitives

theorem of duals, the fundamental system in a mononic container of a dualonic sytsem, which forms the basis of composition, groweth, development, evolution, change (fundamental form-flux dualon)

theorem on the assertion that if mungu (or any theory in the nyumba) exists, then a language/description/representation/observation/perception of that theory should dualonically exist (in correspondence with the kantian noumena-phenomena and godel incompleteness theorems limitations/constraints)

theorems on the levels/layers of abstraction: mungoni-mungon-monon-monad, monogeon, monotopes, monosysts, monogons, monosystems, mononets, monosets, etc...

theorems of mimetics, information spread, gossip protocols/networks, complexity/emergence/organization, epidemiology, and the living (virulent) meme
