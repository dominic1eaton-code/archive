the fundamental theorem of system: in truth, dualonically all things are systems and all things are system. All particles, ideas, physical and metaphysical manifestations, existence and metaexistence and system itself if a system, where all of these systems are merely specific instantiations of the fundamental mungoni system

possibly implying that meta simply means, "that" which is not "this", with there being a stable dualonic relationship between "that" and "this"

possibly further implying that "dualon" is a state of stable relationship, creating a cohesive whole of monon, a relationship from which all other things are derived

the fundamental theory of simulation: an impi of "entity" equipped with a tathri of "perspective" that can "view" (its own) existence, given a ramani of "view", results in the formation of a "simulation" (observation (biased) model), that is the imitation (or mimesis) system of the "meta" (or the fundamental system), forming a stable dualonic pair
* this may further form the foundation of "digital twin theory", which is the theory could facilitate the creation of the digital twin, software defined entity
