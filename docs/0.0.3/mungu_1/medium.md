The Foundations of System
some wild, unproven, unsubstantiated brain dump postulations, round I:
the fundamental theorem of system: all things are dualonically systems and all things are system. All particles, ideas, physical and metaphysical manifestations, existence, meta-existence and system itself is a system, where all of these systems are merely specific instantiations of the fundamental mungoni system, which iteself is a dualonic mungoni<->mungon pair monon, which all are compositions of stable dualonic pair, meaning that all systems are ultimately self stable dualonic pair monons, where these monons are equal to themselves in the fundamental trivial state
possibly implying that meta simply means, "that" which is not "this", with there being a stable dualonic relationship between "that" and "this"
possibly further implying that "dualon" is a state of stable relationship, creating a cohesive whole of monon, a relationship from which all other things are derived
the fundamental theorem of simulation: an impi of "entity" equipped with a tathri of "perspective" that can "view" (its own) existence, given a ramani of "view", and further equipped with a (tathri) "capacity" to "interact" (a ramani operator) with other impi, results in the formation of a "simulation" (observation (biased) model), that is the imitation (or mimesis) system of the "meta" (or the fundamental system), forming a stable dualonic pair
basically saying that simulation is taking (the act/operator/morphism/interaction of taking) a "thing" and taking a "not thing" and mapping them together (in some/any/every/all way(s))
perhaps this can be generalized to any impi that is equipped with "the capability of experience" of any realm/reality/domain, essentially saying that anything that experiences any force, motion, pull, interaction, morphism with any other thing effectively is performing the operator of "simulating" ("twinning"), perhaps with an implication aligning in kantian and godelian limitation theories that a thing (lets call it thing prime) only knows and is limited by its perspective, so interaction with any other thing (not thing prime) is really just a simulation from that thing's (thing prime's) "perspective", assuming the existence of thing prime, not thing prime, perspective, interaction, and simulation
maybe this can be further generalized for a k-ary (kwanza-ary, where a kwanza is an N-ary grouping of (any) "things" (impi), meaning that kwanza groupings are the foundation of S-systems (S-systems being any subset of the U-system, with U-system being the system and meta system of all systems (of systems))), grouping of "thing primes" that together form a mononic (or specifically, monadic), dualonically (self) stable (simulations self stable dualon pair between any two "thing primes"), simulation of any space (i.e. realm, reality, domain (this implying that space, time, dimensions have a/some mapping to realms, realities and domains)) (perhaps this should be incorporated into the fundamental theorem of simulation?), and this maybe further implies that space, time and dimensions are specifically constructed to be the ramani that form the foundation of representation (perspective, observation, perception) (maybe of any impi, entity, actor, agent)
this may further form the foundation of "twin theory" and "digital twin theory", which is the theory that could facilitate the creation of the digital twin, software defined entity
this possibly may further imply that "twins", "mimics", "facsimiles" or "copies" exist and are capable of existence across (and really between) various realms in the realmonic, perhaps forming a connection between various realms, realities, domains through this abstract notion of dualonic twin (perhaps this is what twin theory seeks to understand and study). In concrete terms, there could be an "economics domain" and a "sociology domain" where an entity has an existence in the economics domain and an equivalent twin in the sociology domain, and through a ramani morphism of translation (given a mechanism of translation even exists), forms a stable dualonic pair between these two domains. Maybe this mechanism could exist for any such entity in any such realm, reality or domain, and could be termed "dualonic twin pairing" (maybe corresponding to (and maybe even consistent with) quantum entanglement (in the "physical" realm/reality/domain))
this line of reasoning might further suggest that "twinning" or entanglement are forms of simulation, dualonic twin pairing being the generalized abstract notion of simulation pairing, assuming any of this is even true in the first place of course
perhaps twin theory further is the study and demonstration of the nature of dualonic pairs (of the mungoni)

and furthermore,
if no primitive exists that interacts with the primitive in question, then the primitive in question is said not to exist (i.e. if a tree falls in the woods, and nothing is changed, not air, grass, insects, etc… then the tree is said not to have fallen), and maybe this is a reiteration of the fact that a primitive with no stable dualonic pair (counterpart) does not and is said not to then exist, consummately/perfectly (i.e. "perfect inexistence" (instable dualonic pairs), maybe in comparison to "perfect existence" (stable dualonic pairs))
implying that the dualonic pairs must always exist in order for any primitive to exist
possibly further implying that fundamental trilonic pair of the fundamental monon and fundamental dualon is a dualonic pair that must always exist, where they are one and the same, with A = A
if the meta primitive exists, then its dualonic fundamental primitive must also exist, forming a justification/mechanism of existence
if godelian and kantian constraints say that knowledge (of existence) is limited by perception and observability, this could imply that existence (that which is not known, unknowable by a perceived) forms a stable dualonic pair, where the stability forms the mechanism of existence (itself)
so perhaps there must always be that which is known and that which is not known, there these two primitives, being one and the same, is a mungoni-ic monad (cleaving into a dualonic pair), where the mungoni-ic monad is the fundamental monad of system, a.k.a the meta-system of all systems of systems (recursively)
under this model, the mononic dualon must always exist, and exist in self stability, in order to give rise to the sibi-ic clevitic cleave state that forms existence (existence being the fundamental ramani operator/morphism of change), with clevity being the mechanism of cleaving of existence out of/from non existence
seemingly, ultimately saying that the state of dualonically pair of both existing (or knowing/perceiving) and not existing (or meta existence, non existence, not knowing/perceiving) form a stability dualon that is monadic (a Schrödingerian cat model), when they are recursively one and the same consistently, coherently and uniformly
perhaps forming a basis for quantum models and equally a basis for macro-models of system
and further perhaps indicating that "contradiction" itself is the fundamental monad, with its trilonic dualon counterpart being "consistency", where the stability of this dualon forms the mechanism of existence
so the trivial state of the trivial system could be that contradiction and consistency are one in the same, allowing for the clevity (cleaving, derivation/divergence/forming) of both existence and non existence which simultaneaously exist in a state of dualonic stability with one another
which could possibly mean that: the trivial monad cleaves (into) the substates of contradiction and consistency, which further cleaves into the substates of existence and non existence, which then further cleave into the substates of of reality and non reality (governed by the realmonic), where this cleaving (clevity) is measured by the concept of entropy
then potentially allowing for an impi (impi being the generalization/abstraction of component/element) called "entity" that is equipped with a ramani (ramani being a "transmorphism", the generalization/abstraction of interaction/morphism/change/transition (i.e. a transmorphism is any type of morphism/change/interaction, then "abstracted " into the term ramani)) called "simulation" with this trilonic sibi (the abstraction of all operators) operator which allows for the perception, observation and creation of both the states known as "reality" and "non reality" across a series of "domains"
but perhaps reality and non reality could also be instantiations of different realms within the realmonic, as such the fundamental realm contains the dualon of reality and non reality (assuming the claim that realms contain the subset reality which contain the subset domain)
PROPOSITION:
the fundamental theorem of agent:
agent must holistically, coherently, consistently and uniformly capture 
"simulation", decision, volition (and by extension, autonomy), through all ramani operator(s) of agency, meaning agent is capable of cleaving into both the states of reality and non reality, which produces change and transform within a larger system/network, giving rise to the tathri (tathri being the abstraction/generalization of properties/attribtes/characteristics) of emergence and self-organization, and must operate within the dualon of existence-non existence, which this dualon is governed by the dualon of contradiction-consistency, which when all of these dualons are/become one and the same with themselves (become self referential/describing/equal) become mungoni-ic fundamental system(s), with all of this essentially meaning that the fundamental theorem of agent says that agent must both "exist" and "think", with existence-thinking forming the stable dualonic pair, from this all other states/systems of agent can be cleaved/derived (via agentic clevity (operator/mechanism/ramani))
hopefully this suggests a consistency that all "things" (i.e. entity, actor, agent, particles, impi,system, etc…) are mononic impi, where these mononic "things" are all composed of (a composition of) stable dualonic pairs (respectively)

exploration:
simulation theory of mungu theory forming a basis for the fundamental theorem of agent, where imagination (a specialized form/class/case of simulation) is the fundamental ramani morphism, and mechanism of change (K-system, flux)
differentiating between a perspective that starts from vieweing all potentials at once in comparison from a perspective tat starts from the monad and then producing clevity derivations from that monad
tree on a blank canvas dualonic model: can a tree (or any entity/impi (generalization of component/element) truly exist in a vacuum that contains no elements that are changed by its presence ?
postulation that existence can be separate and independent from qualities (mali, being the generalization of "qualisense" which are the abstraction of any quality/value)
postulation that everything is based in perpective, perception and representation (theory), which is always inherently limited by godelian and kantian constraints
fundamental theorem of entity and fundamental theorem of actor TBD

maybe all of this line of reasoning (based on entity bias, observation, perspective, perception (i.e. my own personal bias/observation/perspective/perception) summarizes to:
the fundamental theorem of existence: no "entity" exists without the "monad" and no "monad" exists without the "entity", with them being effectively on and the same
maybe now even forming a side note: "bias" is both an enabler and constraint of a realm/reality/domain of existence, being a mechanism that forms the basis of observation, perspective, perception and ultimately "representation" (the fundamental theorem of representation? tying into godelian and kantian reality representation constraints)
everything discussed here having the ultimate objective of laying the ground work for the creation of the generic software defined entity operating system
some notes:
everything below is really an assumption (and everything discussed is an assumption too)
impi are the generalization/abstraction/notion of every/any/all components, entites, things, elements; wekhi the generalization of all networks; tathri the generalization of all attributes, properties; indi the abstraction/generalization of all types, classes; mali the generalization of "qaulisense" which represents all qualities, values, senses; ramani the abstraction of "transmorphism" which represents all morphisms, interactions, mappings, transforms, interactions, morphism of morphisms; sibi represents the change between two cleave states (level states), with sibon being the fundamental abstraction of state, such that sibi represents the change/transition/morphism/ramani between any two sibons (any two states (of any kind/type (indi))) which is governed by the mechanism/operator/ramani of "clevity" (the cleave operator (ramani)); so structural configuration within sibons is measured with entropy, and structural configuration between sibons is measured with complexity, assuming the existence of configuration and that sibons have the "capacity" to be "equipped "with configuration (maybe this can be generalized N-dimensionally, and not just 2-dimensionally?)
that monon is the generalization/abstraction of any one "thing" (system, being consistent with the fact that all "things" are a system), dualon is the generalization/abstraction/notion of any two "things", trilon for three, quarton four, etc… to polyons, them being mungonic primitives
the meta-primitives of these primitives being the syntoni = {mo-on, duons, trions, quar-ons, quinons, sexons, etc… polons} with an assumption that all mungon primitives have an associated meta primitive
there exists a U theory that categorizes the nature of U-systems, where U-system = {the system of all system (the meta system), the subset of all systems (a.k.a and S-system, i.e. just the "system)}, this S-system being the any subset of the U-system is further divided into F-systems (form systems) and L-system (flux systems). There are more specialized systems such as P-systems (any mungon primitive (impi, tathri, indi, wekhi (the abstraction of network, relationship), ramani (where impi, tathri, indi, wekhi, ramani are superset primitives that then contain subprimitives such as mali (qualisense, the abtract notation of any/all qualities, and is a specialized tathri), sibi (a specialized ramani), etc…) equipped with any other mungon primitive) , Q-systems (any impi equipped with a tathri), S-system containing a structural systems and K-systems containing all dynamic/kinematic systems
there exists "geometric" representation sets outlining the structure of the mungoni include polons (mungon geometric meta primitive, also known as the syntoni), polyons (mungon geometric primitive), polysysts (abstraction of any complex system), polysystems ("physical" instantations of complex systems), (meta primitive of polygons) polytopes, and polygons (physical instantation of geometry), polygeons (physical geometric object)
there exists a generic operator of change, termed "sibi", where sibi is a special case of the generic term of abstraction of morphism ramani. There then exists a special case of sibi, known as clevity (or clevity operator), that facilitates the "cleaving" of state, forming a "cleave state" (the mechanism by which "one" becomes "two" i.e. the mechanism by which a monon becomes a dualon, where this trilonic pair of monon-dualon (dualon containing two elements (impi)) are themselves a stable dualonic pair
the mungon is the primitive of system and the mungoni is its corresponding meta primitive of system, where the stable dualonic pair form the monon that itself is the fundamental system (i.e. the monad (though in this system, the "monad" really is a specific instance of the monon, i.e. a monad/singleton/etc… are all monons abstractly/generally))
all foundational elements of mungu theory, including mungu unified mathematics (MUM), mungu unified physics (MUP), mungu chain theory (of economics, cryptoeconomics, distributed ledgers, the DAO), U theory, agent theory, and all others are contained within an entity (impi) known as the nyumba. The nyumba serves as the theory that contains all other theories (of/about system), and itself is contained within the mungoni (mungoni-mungon dualon), where the nyumba then serves as the base foundation of any and all theories, following from the fact that everything is a system (a stable mungoni-mungon pair) and then a nyumba (a theory about this fundamental dualonic pair (of (fundamental) system)) would be a theory of all systems, i.e. a "theory of everything"
the language and representation of mungu theory is captured by the nyamba. Nyambic notation is then the symbol set and description used for representing mungu theory, and extension the nyumba, which then by further extension means that nyambic notation is a representation of all theories, and then by even further extension nyambic notation becomes the representation of all systems (i.e. the language of everything), perhaps forming a theory-language of everything dualonic pair with the nyumba, a nyumba-nyamba dualon
it is the idea that by (en)forcing everything to be a dualonic pair (at any/every fundamental "level" throughout this (mungu) theory (and by extension the nyumba and by further extensions all theories (that can/do exist))) is what achieves consistency, and ultimately provide a ramani (mechanism) that leads to justification, truth and meaning
trilonic pairs consist of monons-dualons, and all other pairs are composited in this manner, and it is noted that trilonic pairs are themselves "viewable" (via a ramani/operator of view) then as a monon (a mononic whole), further implying a fractilitc (self similarity, mimetic, imitative, "simulative"), recursive, cleaving state mechanism, whose metric(s) are captured by the metrics of "complexity" and "entropy", and also such further compositions can be "viewed" in this similar abstract/generalized way, further implying that everything is both itself and a monon dualonic pair (i.e. monon-monon = monon, monon-dualon = monon = trilon, monon-trilon = monon, etc…), this all representing a "trivial state" (perhaps suggesting a law of triviality)
symmetry-asmmetry dualon pair(s) give rise to change
perhaps the idea of "level" is characterized then by the number of "cleave states" that exist, mapping to the metrics of "entropy" and "complexity", so maybe this means that an individual "cleave state" is a "level" (perhaps of complexity) and each level (or "level state") has a number of "microstates" (or a "configuration" (a qualitative property (mali))) "measured" by entropy, so maybe this all means that there exists a two dimensional "metric" system, a dualonic pair of complexity-metric, for a "structure" of connected cleave states (i.e. a structure that containes a series of cleave states, where one state cleaves into another state (via the clevity operator)), where the "breadth-wise" metric is entropy that measure microstates within a particular cleaved state, and the "depth/length-wise" metric is complexity measuring the increased/decreased and generally changed configuration between cleave states, level states (a geometric structure that can be characterized by a "dualtope"/"duagon")
it is believed/assumed that the monotopic, dualtopic, tritopic, … polytopic metageometric abstract structure and corresponding monogonic, duagonic, trigonic, … polygonic abstract geometric structure can be mapped to tensors as well, 1D tensors being/mapping/morphing to monotopes/monogons, 2D tensors to duatopes/duagons, … ND tensors to polytopes/polygons/polygeons, and perhaps more clarity and better terms are needed for this idea
a "convention "of words ending in -i is used to indicate that something is a meta-primitive (of a primitive), (a meta-primitive<->primitive self stable dualonic pair)

everything here is purely theoretical and abstract, and not deemed to be neither true nor false, just simply existing, with the hope of being coherent and consistent, and will be updated and adjusted in a manner akin to a bayesian filter like model update system
<-> is the symbol for the "pair(ing)" operator
finally there would be a venture to say that if everything is not a system, then perhaps none of this is true (as a whole, then maybe only containing partial truths within it, perhaps further forming another self stabilizing dualonic pair of truth<->partial truth, or truth<->non truth where partial truth is a special case of non truth (in the context of everything being wholly true or everything being wholly not true (subcase then of being partially true)))
hopefully though, enough consistency and coherence can be captured as to lay the theoretical ground work, via this mungu (system) theory, for the field of systemology (the study of system(s)) and the field of systemics (the practical application of system(s))
