All of this seems to be boiling down to:
Existence, reality, understanding, perception and the full scope of everything that was, is and will be, is at its core not composed of particles, all and every of these things, in totality, is a composition fundamentally of interactions (the long winded statement version)
Life isn't made up of separate, independent particles, it is made of and from connections (a shorter quip version, where hopefully mungu theory can shed some light on what this is and even means, assuming it means anything at all)
personal side note: this model may just be a re-invention of the wheel here, assuming any of this holds any truth or even matters, but following the logic of the mungu theoretical model (based on my own personal biases, limitated constraints, and empirical observations), this model would suggest that existence began not with a single particle, but with an interaction (perhaps a fundamental "field" (of interaction)), that then cleaved in two, the two halves being the base fundamental particles (perhaps complimentary higgs bosons?) that were then at the "ends" of this interaction that then created the entity (perhaps simulation?) known as "existence". in the meta-model of this (physical) model, an abstract meta-field (the mungoni), cleaved into a complimentary self stable dualonic pair monon of mungons, and maybe these two mungons were "symmetry" and "asymmetry", where symmetry cleaved into symmetry<->asymmetry and conversely asymmetry cleaved into asymmetry<->symmetry (noting that these are two seperate configurations), and with a further implied fact that a "thing" cleaves into itself<->not-itself (a.k.a a subset of itself), which may then lead to that statement of saying that symmetry leads/led to asymmetry and concomitantly/concurrently/simultaneously asymmetry leads/led into symmetry, all of this forming the foundation of form<->flux/ structure<->flow/statics<->dynamics. Maybe this can further be characterized as symmetric (stable) sibonic states led/leads to asymmetry (unstable) sibi-ic (where maybe sibi (and by extension cleaving/clevity) is just a special case sibonic state (a.k.a an unstable sibonic state is a state of transition, and a stable sibonic state is a state of non transition)) states and vice-versa, so order from chaos happens simultaneously as chaos from order, where the fundamental interaction (maybe this/the fundamental interaction should be what is called/known as sibi?) between chaos<->order and order<->chaos is what beget both order and chaos simultaneously. I think this all flows logically from the central theme of "interaction (of field)" first, particles second theoretical model being describe here, and suppose that I may just be saying that a "higgs (interaction) field" came first and dual "higgs particles" came second (perhaps implying that is known as the higgs boson (itself being composed of a self stable dualonic pair) has some complimentary dual bosonic particle maybe, idk? or maybe even the higgs boson is an "asymmetry" where "things " can exist and there is some complimentary "symmetry" particle where no "things" exist, where these complimentary particles form a self stable dualonic pair monon (that monon effectively being the fundamental interaction that "created" them to begin with) (this all is an attempt to put this model in terms that aligns with my current (very limited (as I am more of a (abstract (being specific here to indicate that I don't concern myself with (low level) details, just the high level (details)) systems logician theorist than a physicist) understanding of modern physics)). Maybe sibi can be used to be the representation of any "cleaving" a.k.a any "interaction", so all of this feeling like very circular/circuitous reasoning now: in the "beginning", there was a fundamental interaction (a type of sibi, the fundamental sibi) that then cleaved into two sibonic states (them being two halves of a self stabilized dualonic pair monon (that monon being the fundamental interaction (concept captured by sibi and clevity (the cleave operator)))) @todo (mathematically) formalize and define "stabilize", "self", "pair", "begin(ning)", "end(ing)"; discuss that maybe begin(ning)<->end(ing) are themselves a self stabilized dualonic pair monon; produce a law of self stabilized dualonic pairs (monons). This might all be taken further to say that if we follow the route of saying that existence "the higgs boson" is an asymmetry, that is necessary and sufficient to create the condition of existence, this might be contradiction to the fact that every "thing" (thing probably shoule really be captured by the term "impi" here and throughout this entire text, as impi is the abstraction of element/primitive/component/etc… and perhaps now "thing") needs to be stable (symmetry) in order for any "thing" (impi) to exist, so perhaps "asymmetry" (effectively the abstraction/meta-primitive("thing"/impi) of the higgs boson) is a symmetrically (stably/"perfectly") asymmetric impi, which may further in context just be a very long way to say that in the "universe" that contains "existence", asymmetry (higgs boson, disorder, chaos, etc… all being analogous/synonym/equal terms) came first, then came symmetry, noting that in the term "symmetrical(ly) asymmetry", symmetry is a tathri (with tathri being the abstract notion of characteristic, property, attribute) and asymmetry is the/an impi all this further conversly perhaps suggesting that in the "universe of non existence", symmetric came first (a perfectly asymmetric symmetry??), maybe in some way this might also map to symmetry being consistency and asymmetry being contradiction, all this to say that the "universe of existence" is a consistent contradiction and the "universe of non existence" is a contradictory consistence, which might be intuitively suggesting that no "thing (in the "universe of existence") can ever truly be consistent, as there will always be some contradiction (still attempting to preserve the law of excluded middle here) a.k.a there will always be "change" and conversely in the complimentary "universe of non existence" no contradiction has/can/will (these words here assuming this observer is looking through an preceptive lens that is "equipped " with a concept of "time") ever come about (a.k.a there will never be any "change") (all this being a bit scary to think about honestly). All this hoopla now in a concrete example: which came first, the chicken or the egg? well in the universe of existence (that contains existence), if asymmetry is the chicken and symmetry the egg, then the chicken came first, giving birth to an egg (that then become another chicken, this all occurring in a fractilic (self similar), recursive cycle (perhaps interminably)). Conversely, in the world of non existence, symmetry would be the egg that would, had, and/or will never become the chicken of asymmetry… (perhaps some kind of "chickens of asymmetry" and "eggs of symmetry" law(s) should/could be established here?) (a really broad statement here might be that no thing ever truly really "lives" or "dies", it and all things just merely change (atleast in the world of asymmetry) (don't know yet if that feels comforting or not))
expanding on chickens and eggs, in the world of existence, where the chicken came first, it then cleaved into a(the) chicken and an egg, where of course in the world of non existence it might be suggested that the egg of this world never cleaved (as no "things" ever change), further suggesting that the dividing line here is that the world of existence, or asymmetry (itself), is equipped with the operator "cleave" (i.e. it is equipped with the clevity operator), while "symmetry" is not equipped with such an operator (maybe). Also would like to note that the operation of clevity fundamentally results in: A = {A, not A}, and perhaps should do so consistently (symmetrically), which maybe by some intuitive notion would suggest (given that anything being said here is even remotely true at all) that the "consistency" is an impi that is not equipped with clevity (the cleave/clevity operator), and therefore cannot change (or really can never be decomposed (further)), so laws really are just impi not equipped with the clevity operator, but of course since the laws of the universe of existence (and really every "thing" (impi)) in the universe of existence at its fundamental level stems from asymmetry, one might be able to claim that everything could potentially be equipped with the clevity operator (essentially any "thing" and every "thing" could change (maybe with a condition of "enough" time and "enough" space, or "enough" any "thing"/metric, etc…)), so really this is all maybe just saying that nothing can never really be fully "perfect" or "known" or completely (aka "perfectly") consistent/true, with this being the fundamental "limitation/constraint" of asymmetry being equipped with a clevity operator, and by extension everything that is cleaved from asymmetry (this is assuming that everything cleaved from asymmetry is also equipped with the same operator (and perhaps all operators (ramani), and characteristics (tathri)) as asymmetry itself) also has the same limitation of never fully being true/perfect/complete/known/unchanging/perfectly-symmetric. Hopefully this is in alignment with godel incompleteness and kantian perception/perspective constraints (in the treatment of this model these constraints are assumed and hopefully shown to be in alignment). This all boiling down to perhaps a more colloquial quip: "We're all merely chickens of asymmetry, just out here in these streets laying eggs of symmetry"
new language, terms, and notations were developed based on the idea that all existence is really just an instantion of some larger "abstraction", where the new language, terms, symbols, notation then operate at and provide a description of that "abstraction" (this language/representation being called nymabic notation) (also where this is perhaps another self stable dualonic pair monon of "abstraction"<->(concrete)"existence"). So these terms like monon (abstract concept of a "one", which would have concrete analogs of mo-on, monoton, monogon, monosyst, mononet, monoset, monogeon, "the monad"), dualon (abstract notion of any "two" (of any/every thing)), impi (abstract notion of element/component/primitive/entity), sibi (abstract notion of transition/interaction?), sibons (abstract notion of state (either stable or unstable)), etc… are the language of the abstraction (of existence, and by extension any/everything really…). And of course this all follows from the fundamental idea that there is "thing"<->"meta-thing" (concrete<->abstract) self stable dualonic pair monon
@todo look into the mechanism of doubt phenomenon; incorporate the mechanism/operator of traction; explore the nature and implications of outsider theory; establish the institute of systemics (the Songhai Institute); discuss the intuition and formalize the notion of Ka/Ni/Se (and the songhai-model), it being a very fundamental component of the mungu theory model and hopefully a gateway to the path of formalized AGI models, software defined entites/agent, digital twin simulations, terraformata, civilization theory (terraformata theory (formalized models to create, develop, manage, scale and extend civilizations)) and civilization engineering, and consciousness process coherence preservation models (a.k.a formalized models to extend biological life); describe, define and formalize black-swans ("A high-impact, low-predictability emergence event produced by hidden systemic degrees of freedom crossing an unrecognized activation threshold within a system's trilon-field." more compactly: "An unmodeled emergence channel becoming active.", where It is not randomness.
 It is latent structure activating under conditions the system cannot currently represent.)

roadmap of the future (where hopefully the mere presence of this theory will speed things along…):
Possible Worlds
ChatGPTs roadmap of possible futuresmedium.com
the fundamental theorem of system: all things are, dualonically stable mononic, systems and all things are system. All particles, ideas, physical and metaphysical manifestations, existence, meta-existence and system itself is a system, where all of these systems are merely specific instantiations of the fundamental mungoni system, which itself is a dualonic mungoni<->mungon pair monon, which all are compositions of stable dualonic pair, meaning that all systems are ultimately self stable dualonic pair monons, where these monons are equal to themselves in the fundamental trivial state (the fundamental sibon)
Autotrilon: A self-stable dualonic pair monon trilon (all of this which is itself a monon (hopefully all this abstraction isnt too trippy, but it probably is…)) - internally balancing, auto-generative
Heterotrilon: A non-self-stable trilon
Importance: Autotrilons are the minimal self-consistent entities in unified Mungu dynamics
where the fundamental sibon is the fundamental trivial state
possibly implying that meta simply means, "that" which is not "this", with there being a stable dualonic relationship between "that" and "this"
possibly further implying that "dualon" is a state of stable relationship, creating a cohesive whole of monon, a relationship from which all other things are derived
maybe a further reiteration of this could be that classical models view existence as a sibonic structure, and this (post modern?) model views existence as a sibi-ic structure

this all then might imply a law, namely "the law of dualonic (self) stability"
the fundamental theorem of simulation: an impi of "entity" equipped with a tathri of "perspective" that can "view" (its own) existence, given a ramani of "view", and further equipped with a (tathri) "capacity" to "interact" (a ramani operator) with other impi, results in the formation of a "simulation" (observation (biased) model), that is the imitation (or mimesis) system of the "meta" (or the fundamental system), forming a stable dualonic pair
basically saying that simulation is taking (the act/operator/morphism/interaction of taking) a "thing" and taking a "not thing" and mapping them together (in some/any/every/all way(s))
perhaps this can be generalized to any impi that is equipped with "the capability of experience" of any realm/reality/domain, essentially saying that anything that experiences any force, motion, pull, interaction, morphism with any other thing effectively is performing the operator of "simulating" ("twinning"), perhaps with an implication aligning in kantian and godelian limitation theories that a thing (lets call it thing prime) only knows and is limited by its perspective, so interaction with any other thing (not thing prime) is really just a simulation from that thing's (thing prime's) "perspective", assuming the existence of thing prime, not thing prime, perspective, interaction, and simulation
maybe this can be further generalized for a k-ary (kwanza-ary, where a kwanza is an N-ary grouping of (any) "things" (impi), meaning that kwanza groupings are the foundation of S-systems (S-systems being any subset of the U-system, with U-system being the system and meta system of all systems (of systems))), grouping of "thing primes" that together form a mononic (or specifically, monadic), dualonically (self) stable (simulations self stable dualon pair between any two "thing primes"), simulation of any space (i.e. realm, reality, domain (this implying that space, time, dimensions have a/some mapping to realms, realities and domains)) (perhaps this should be incorporated into the fundamental theorem of simulation?), and this maybe further implies that space, time and dimensions are specifically constructed to be the ramani that form the foundation of representation (perspective, observation, perception) (maybe of any impi, entity, actor, agent). This might be the basis of the (social) contract and "the fundamental agreement", which is the formation of a stable dualonic pair between entities, creating a stable, consistent and coherent simulation between them, an uniformly among all entities who perform or are equipped with this operator (the operator of agreement, leading to contract/bond/promise, resulting in cohesion, alignment and coherence and operating via mimetics (memes) and simulation), with the idea that there is an abstract notion of "agreement" (i.e. newtonian mechanics, as when an object collides with another, the "agreement" is that both objects will react to one another, in a bonded/bound "contract"), which can further be concretized in different realm, realities, domains (e.g. the "social" contract of eusocial entities can be one such instantiation/manifestation of the abstract notion of contract/agreement (~maybe give a name to these abstract notions of agreement and contract ?))
this may further form the foundation of "twin theory" and "digital twin theory", which is the theory that could facilitate the creation of the digital twin, software defined entity
this possibly may further imply that "twins", "mimics", "facsimiles" or "copies" exist and are capable of existence across (and really between) various realms in the realmonic, perhaps forming a connection between various realms, realities, domains through this abstract notion of dualonic twin (perhaps this is what twin theory seeks to understand and study). In concrete terms, there could be an "economics domain" and a "sociology domain" where an entity has an existence in the economics domain and an equivalent twin in the sociology domain, and through a ramani morphism of translation (given a mechanism of translation even exists), forms a stable dualonic pair between these two domains. Maybe this mechanism could exist for any such entity in any such realm, reality or domain, and could be termed "dualonic twin pairing" (maybe corresponding to (and maybe even consistent with) quantum entanglement (in the "physical" realm/reality/domain))
this line of reasoning might further suggest that "twinning" or entanglement are forms of simulation, dualonic twin pairing being the generalized abstract notion of simulation pairing, assuming any of this is even true in the first place of course
perhaps twin theory further is the study and demonstration of the nature of dualonic pairs (of the mungoni)

and furthermore,
if no primitive exists that interacts with the primitive in question, then the primitive in question is said not to exist (i.e. if a tree falls in the woods, and nothing is changed, not air, grass, insects, etc… then the tree is said not to have fallen), and maybe this is a reiteration of the fact that a primitive with no stable dualonic pair (counterpart) does not and is said not to then exist, consummately/perfectly (i.e. "perfect inexistence" (instable dualonic pairs), maybe in comparison to "perfect existence" (stable dualonic pairs))
implying that the dualonic pairs must always exist in order for any primitive to exist
possibly further implying that fundamental trilonic pair of the fundamental monon and fundamental dualon is a dualonic pair that must always exist, where they are one and the same, with A = A
if the meta primitive exists, then its dualonic fundamental primitive must also exist, forming a justification/mechanism of existence
if godelian and kantian constraints say that knowledge (of existence) is limited by perception and observability, this could imply that existence (that which is not known, unknowable by a perceived) forms a stable dualonic pair, where the stability forms the mechanism of existence (itself)
so perhaps there must always be that which is known and that which is not known, there these two primitives, being one and the same, is a mungoni-ic monad (cleaving into a dualonic pair), where the mungoni-ic monad is the fundamental monad of system, a.k.a the meta-system of all systems of systems (recursively)
under this model, the mononic dualon must always exist, and exist in self stability, in order to give rise to the sibi-ic clevitic cleave state that forms existence (existence being the fundamental ramani operator/morphism of change), with clevity being the mechanism of cleaving of existence out of/from non existence
seemingly, ultimately saying that the state of dualonically pair of both existing (or knowing/perceiving) and not existing (or meta existence, non existence, not knowing/perceiving) form a stability dualon that is monadic (a Schrödingerian cat model), when they are recursively one and the same consistently, coherently and uniformly
perhaps forming a basis for quantum models and equally a basis for macro-models of system
and further perhaps indicating that "contradiction" itself is the fundamental monad, with its trilonic dualon counterpart being "consistency", where the stability of this dualon forms the mechanism of existence
so the trivial state of the trivial system could be that contradiction and consistency are one in the same, allowing for the clevity (cleaving, derivation/divergence/forming) of both existence and non existence which simultaneaously exist in a state of dualonic stability with one another
which could possibly mean that: the trivial monad cleaves (into) the substates of contradiction and consistency, which further cleaves into the substates of existence and non existence, which then further cleave into the substates of of reality and non reality (governed by the realmonic), where this cleaving (clevity) is measured by the concept of entropy
then potentially allowing for an impi (impi being the generalization/abstraction of component/element) called "entity" that is equipped with a ramani (ramani being a "transmorphism", the generalization/abstraction of interaction/morphism/change/transition (i.e. a transmorphism is any type of morphism/change/interaction, then "abstracted " into the term ramani)) called "simulation" with this trilonic sibi (the abstraction of all operators) operator which allows for the perception, observation and creation of both the states known as "reality" and "non reality" across a series of "domains"
but perhaps reality and non reality could also be instantiations of different realms within the realmonic, as such the fundamental realm contains the dualon of reality and non reality (assuming the claim that realms contain the subset reality which contain the subset domain)
PROPOSITION:
the fundamental theorem of agent:
agent must holistically, coherently, consistently and uniformly capture 
"simulation", decision, volition (and by extension, autonomy), through all ramani operator(s) of agency, meaning agent is capable of cleaving into both the states of reality and non reality, which produces change and transform within a larger system/network, giving rise to the tathri (tathri being the abstraction/generalization of properties/attribtes/characteristics) of emergence and self-organization, and must operate within the dualon of existence-non existence, which this dualon is governed by the dualon of contradiction-consistency, which when all of these dualons are/become one and the same with themselves (become self referential/describing/equal) become mungoni-ic fundamental system(s), with all of this essentially meaning that the fundamental theorem of agent says that agent must both "exist" and "think", with existence-thinking forming the stable dualonic pair, from this all other states/systems of agent can be cleaved/derived (via agentic clevity (operator/mechanism/ramani))
hopefully this suggests a consistency that all "things" (i.e. entity, actor, agent, particles, impi,system, etc…) are mononic impi, where these mononic "things" are all composed of (a composition of) stable dualonic pairs (respectively)

exploration:
simulation theory of mungu theory forming a basis for the fundamental theorem of agent, where imagination (a specialized form/class/case of simulation) is the fundamental ramani morphism, and mechanism of change (K-system, flux)
differentiating between a perspective that starts from vieweing all potentials at once in comparison from a perspective tat starts from the monad and then producing clevity derivations from that monad
tree on a blank canvas dualonic model: can a tree (or any entity/impi (generalization of component/element) truly exist in a vacuum that contains no elements that are changed by its presence ?
postulation that existence can be separate and independent from qualities (mali, being the generalization of "qualisense" which are the abstraction of any quality/value)
postulation that everything is based in perpective, perception and representation (theory), which is always inherently limited by godelian and kantian constraints
fundamental theorem of entity and fundamental theorem of actor TBD

maybe all of this line of reasoning (based on entity bias, observation, perspective, perception (i.e. my own personal bias/observation/perspective/perception) summarizes to:
the fundamental theorem of existence: no "entity" exists without the "monad" and no "monad" exists without the "entity", with them being effectively one and the same. This all being in correspondence with the fundamental fact that it is neither entity nor monad that is the primitive of existence, but the interaction between them that is the fundamental primitive of existence
maybe now even forming a side note: "bias" is both an enabler and constraint of a realm/reality/domain of existence, being a mechanism that forms the basis of observation, perspective, perception and ultimately "representation" (the fundamental theorem of representation? tying into godelian and kantian reality representation constraints)
everything discussed here having the ultimate objective of laying the ground work for the creation of the generic software defined entity operating system
some notes:
everything below is really an assumption (and everything discussed is an assumption too)
impi are the generalization/abstraction/notion of every/any/all components, entites, things, elements; wekhi the generalization of all networks; tathri the generalization of all attributes, properties; indi the abstraction/generalization of all types, classes; mali the generalization of "qaulisense" which represents all qualities, values, senses; ramani the abstraction of "transmorphism" which represents all morphisms, interactions, mappings, transforms, interactions, morphism of morphisms; sibi represents the change between two cleave states (level states), with sibon being the fundamental abstraction of state, such that sibi represents the change/transition/morphism/ramani between any two sibons (any two states (of any kind/type (indi))) which is governed by the mechanism/operator/ramani of "clevity" (the cleave operator (ramani)); so structural configuration within sibons is measured with entropy, and structural configuration between sibons is measured with complexity, assuming the existence of configuration and that sibons have the "capacity" to be "equipped "with configuration (maybe this can be generalized N-dimensionally, and not just 2-dimensionally?)
that monon is the generalization/abstraction of any one "thing" (system, being consistent with the fact that all "things" are a system), dualon is the generalization/abstraction/notion of any two "things", trilon for three, quarton four, etc… to polyons, them being mungonic primitives
the meta-primitives of these primitives being the syntoni = {mo-on, duons, trions, quar-ons, quinons, sexons, etc… polons} with an assumption that all mungon primitives have an associated meta primitive
there exists a U theory that categorizes the nature of U-systems, where U-system = {the system of all system (the meta system), the subset of all systems (a.k.a and S-system, i.e. just the "system)}, this S-system being the any subset of the U-system is further divided into F-systems (form systems) and L-system (flux systems). There are more specialized systems such as P-systems (any mungon primitive (impi, tathri, indi, wekhi (the abstraction of network, relationship), ramani (where impi, tathri, indi, wekhi, ramani are superset primitives that then contain subprimitives such as mali (qualisense, the abtract notation of any/all qualities, and is a specialized tathri), sibi (a specialized ramani), etc…) equipped with any other mungon primitive) , Q-systems (any impi equipped with a tathri), T-system containing a structural systems and K-systems containing all dynamic/kinematic systems; all systems are S-systems, where they are subsets/systems of the U-system, with the U-system being an S-system subset of itself
there exists form/structural "geometric" representation sets (or categories?) outlining the structure of the mungoni and includes polons (mungon geometric meta primitive, also known as the syntoni), polyons (mungon geometric primitive), polysysts (abstraction of any complex system), polysystems ("physical" instantations of complex systems), (meta primitive of polygons) polytopes, and polygons (physical instantation of geometry), polygeons (physical geometric object)
there exists flux/change "flow-ic?" representation sets (or categories?) outlining the "flow" of the mungoni, and includes (corresponding to T-system impi, i.e. polons,etc…) kolons, kolyons, kolytons, kolytopes?, kolysysts?, kolygeons? kolygons (physical manifestations of time (position, velocity, etc…) i.e. motion?)? with a meta primitive called the flyntoni
also it is assumed that for all impi (syntoni, flyntoni), there is an associated U-system, and by extension S-system, and furthermore all mungonic primitives (impi, tathri, ramani, indi, wekhi, sibi, mali) have an associated U-system (and S-system), essentially saying that all mungonic (meta)primitives (components, elements, characteristics, qualities, types, operators, morphisms, networks, sets, etc…) exist within a structured system that defines how these (meta)primitives behave, interact and evolve (through structure and flow), with the aim of ensuring that all "elements/things" of the mungu theory, from its basic primitives to complex systems, are all governed by consistent principles, rules and laws. The K-system acts as the organizing force that "flow-ically" maintains coherence across different systems a nd enables the "emergence of (complex) behaviors", and the corresponding T-system acts as the organizing structure that "geometrically/structurally" maintains coherence across different systems and enables the "emergence of (complex) structures", and furthermore there then may exist a "manifold" of structure-behavior that governs all mungonic (meta)primitives; all of this is then characterized by an M-system, an abstraction of all manifolds, that includes the "specialized" (indic,tathric) manifold (lets call it the O-manifold or obatala-manifold), that maps all mungonic (primitives) to all other corresponding S-systems, with the M-system itself being a type of S-system; but this might seem to imply that the U-system decomposes into the S-system (or metasystem<->system dualon) which then the "system" dualonic counterpart further decomposes into the manifold<->non-manifold (or M-system, non M-system) dualon, where then are two S-systems, where one S-system has structure-behavior and one S-system does not. This line of reason also seems to bring up the fact, that a "thing" "existing" or not is a fundamental dividing "factor " in cleaving any two systems (perhaps an indication that the existence operator (or some notion of the "existence factor"?) is the fundamental sibi, and clevity operator (which of course is based from the bias of this observer, i.e. my own personal biases/perceptions/observations))
there exists a generic operator of change, termed "sibi", where sibi is a special case of the generic term of abstraction of morphism ramani. There then exists a special case of sibi, known as clevity (or clevity operator), that facilitates the "cleaving" of state, forming a "cleave state" (the mechanism by which "one" becomes "two" i.e. the mechanism by which a monon becomes a dualon, where this trilonic pair of monon-dualon (dualon containing two elements (impi)) are themselves a stable dualonic pair
the mungon is the primitive of system and the mungoni is its corresponding meta primitive of system, where the stable dualonic pair form the monon that itself is the fundamental system (i.e. the monad (though in this system, the "monad" really is a specific instance of the monon, i.e. a monad/singleton/etc… are all monons abstractly/generally))
all foundational elements of mungu theory, including mungu unified mathematics (MUM), mungu unified physics (MUP), mungu chain theory (of economics, cryptoeconomics, distributed ledgers, the DAO), U theory, agent theory, and all others are contained within an entity (impi) known as the nyumba. The nyumba serves as the theory that contains all other theories (of/about system), and itself is contained within the mungoni (mungoni-mungon dualon), where the nyumba then serves as the base foundation of any and all theories, following from the fact that everything is a system (a stable mungoni-mungon pair) and then a nyumba (a theory about this fundamental dualonic pair (of (fundamental) system)) would be a theory of all systems, i.e. a "theory of everything"
the language and representation of mungu theory is captured by the nyamba. Nyambic notation is then the symbol set and description used for representing mungu theory, and extension the nyumba, which then by further extension means that nyambic notation is a representation of all theories, and then by even further extension nyambic notation becomes the representation of all systems (i.e. the language of everything), perhaps forming a theory-language of everything dualonic pair with the nyumba, a nyumba-nyamba dualon, which may be an attempt to say that for every "thing" (lets call it thing prime again), there must also exist a corresponding representation of thing prime, and this ultimately becomes the basis that leads to simulation theory, as thing prime exists, a dualonic counterpart representation of thing prime exists, and this dualonic counterpart representation perhaps effectively is the "simulation", maybe even further suggesting that "language" itself is simulation (to "speak" something into existence, colloquially). Mungu representation theory then also seeks to understand the "abstract language" that forms any/all/every representation of system (that form a dualonic monon with the existing system itself). All of this possibly implying that if a "thing " exists, or if some "thing" happens, then a "description" or "representation" of that thing also becomes possible and exists in dualonic stability with thing prime, maybe further reiterating the fact that if thing prime cannot be represented, it is "said" not to exist, fundamentally. Moreover this could also suggest a potential law of representation
it is the idea that by (en)forcing everything to be a dualonic pair (at any/every fundamental "level" throughout this (mungu) theory (and by extension the nyumba and by further extensions all theories (that can/do exist))) is what achieves consistency, and ultimately provide a ramani (mechanism) that leads to justification, truth and meaning. This may also lead into the question of why the mungonic primitives (impi, indi, sibi, etc…) were chosen to be as such to begin with. Perhaps they were chosen to be primitives in order to satisfy this law of duality/dualonic stability since the satisfying of this law is what would directly lead to consistency, coherence, and unification so perhaps mungonic primitives (and really the decision to define any thing in this theory really) is driven by this fundamental law of dualonic stability, choosing abstractions and defining theoretical foundations that aim to satisfy this law. Further implying a mungu proof theory where all proofs of mungu theory are fundamentally proofs that fundamental law of dualonic stability holds (in whatever context of the theory (or any theory, by the extension of nyumba) proofs are being applied)
trilonic pairs consist of monons-dualons, and all other pairs are composited in this manner, and it is noted that trilonic pairs are themselves "viewable" (via a ramani/operator of view) then as a monon (a mononic whole), further implying a fractilic (self similarity, mimetic, imitative, "simulative"), recursive, cleaving state mechanism, whose metric(s) are captured by the metrics of "complexity" and "entropy", and also such further compositions can be "viewed" in this similar abstract/generalized way, further implying that everything is both itself and a monon dualonic pair (i.e. monon-monon = monon, monon-dualon = monon = trilon, monon-trilon = monon, etc…), this all representing a "trivial state" (the fundamental sibon), perhaps suggesting a law of triviality (or law of the fundamental sibon)
symmetry-asmmetry dualon pair(s) give rise to change
perhaps the idea of "level" is characterized then by the number of "cleave states" that exist, mapping to the metrics of "entropy" and "complexity", so maybe this means that an individual "cleave state" is a "level" (perhaps of complexity) and each level (or "level state") has a number of "microstates" (or a "configuration" (a qualitative property (mali))) "measured" by entropy, so maybe this all means that there exists a two dimensional "metric" system, a dualonic pair of complexity-metric, for a "structure" of connected cleave states (i.e. a structure that containes a series of cleave states, where one state cleaves into another state (via the clevity operator)), where the "breadth-wise" metric is entropy that measure microstates within a particular cleaved state, and the "depth/length-wise" metric is complexity measuring the increased/decreased and generally changed configuration between cleave states, level states (a geometric structure that can be characterized by a "dualtope"/"duagon")
it is believed/assumed that the monotopic, dualtopic, tritopic, … polytopic metageometric abstract structure and corresponding monogonic, duagonic, trigonic, … polygonic abstract geometric structure can be mapped to tensors as well, 1D tensors being/mapping/morphing to monotopes/monogons, 2D tensors to duatopes/duagons, … ND tensors to polytopes/polygons/polygeons, and perhaps more clarity and better terms are needed for this idea
a "convention "of words ending in -i is used to indicate that something is a meta-primitive (of a primitive), (a meta-primitive<->primitive self stable dualonic pair)
noting that the use of adjectives (tathri) "mungonic" applies to anything pertaining to the mungon and "mungoni-ic" pertains to anything concerning the mungoni
@todo toss in the LoF laws of form somewhere in the mungu theory and see what happens. Give a formalization of the concepts of A, not A, boundary, distiction and bias, all within the context of mungu theory. Formalize and define what it means for some/any/every thing to be a self stable dualonic pair and a self stable dualonic pair monon. Introduce the mechanism of "logic", its role in mungu theory and the mechanism that governs the formation of mungu theory, the nyumba, and by extension the mechanism that governs the formation of any theory

everything here is purely theoretical and abstract, and not deemed to be neither true nor false, just simply existing, with the hope of being coherent and consistent, and will be updated and adjusted in a manner akin to a bayesian filter like model update system
<-> is the symbol for the "pair(ing)" operator
finally there would be a venture to say that if everything is not a system, then perhaps none of this is true (as a whole, then maybe only containing partial truths within it, perhaps further forming another self stabilizing dualonic pair of truth<->partial truth, or truth<->non truth where partial truth is a special case of non truth (in the context of everything being wholly true or everything being wholly not true (subcase then of being partially true)))
"under " this framework the idea (theory) that "everything is a system" is the mungon/monon, from which all other "things " are cleaved (derived), with the idea that there exists a corresponding (self dualonically stable) mungoni that serves as the foundation of any theory that serves as the basis from which any/every/all "things" are cleaved, as to capture the notion that no theory can fully characterize "everything", yet that does not preclude the existence of a theory that does fully characterize "everything", these two notions having a "perfect existence" (a self stable dualonic pair monon), asserting a "law of dualonality" that all/every/every thing that exists must have a corresponding dualonic pair counterpart (maybe lets call the impi of the dualon pair the alphon and the omegon, so dualon = {alphon, omegon}). Hopefully this takes care of the fact that if some other theory pops up that is more fundamental than this one, it will merely supplant the mungon, while perserving the mungoni (perhaps this perservation should also be encoded in some law/theorem/postulate? and also probably there should be some formalization of the notion of "(en)codification")
The trilonic pair of the dualon, alphon and omegon is modelled then by the "obatala model" which consistents of an alphon known as "oshun" (flux, F-system) and an omegon known as "ogun" (form, L-system), these two impi being the abstract representation of push<->pull, system<->controller, agent<->principle, primal<->dual, monad<->comonad, symmetry<->asymmetry self stable dualonic pairs, which ultimately all give rise to "structure" and "change", so obatala = {ogun, oshun} = {form, flux} = {structure, change}, mapping to obatala -> {polons, kolons} -> {polyons, kolyons} -> {polytons, kolytons} -…-> {polytopes, kolytopes (generalization of Nth order derivatives maybe?)} = "obatalic manifold?" where polons, etc… are the fundamental structural T-system impi and kolons, etc… are the dynamic/kinematic K-system impi, so T-system impi (polons, etc…) fundamental characterize and describe form/structure and K-system impi (kolons, etc…) fundamentally describe flux/change (e.g. space and time, with "spacetime" being an obatalic monad (manifold?)?)
@todo unify, cohere, and make consistent polons, polyons, polytons, polytopes, polysysts, polygeons, polygons, polynets, polysets, "polycats? (poly-categories)", and corresponding K-system impi, and also toss in "manifold" into mungu theory and see what happens
this then all captures some primitive systems, namely:
mungoni<->mungon dualonic monon: the "fundamental" system
mungoni: the meta system of meta systems
mungon: the system of systems
nyumba: the system of the theory systems (the mungu theory system)
nyamba: the system of system languages (the common language that describes all systems)
A-system: the fundamental system of the mungoni-ic (meta)system
U-system: the fundamental mungonic system (any subset(s) of the A-system)
S-System: any subset(s) of the U-system

hopefully though, enough consistency and coherence can be captured as to lay the theoretical ground work, via this mungu (system) theory, for the field of systemology (the study of system(s)) and the field of systemics (the practical application of system(s))
planned publications to come:
the systems series: mungu theory (seminal paper of a unified and formalized system(s) theory)

and then it happened

There is no doubt that there are errors, inconsistencies and redundancies throughout everything discussed in this first attempt to formalize a theory of system(s), and hopefully things will be more coherently, comprehensively and rigorously worked out as time goes on, forming a foundation for the unified theory of system
this all being proposed by an observer who is a systems theorist, a systemologist, a systemicist, a systemics architect, a systemics designer, a systemics scientist, a systemics engineer (with a specialization in general purpose operating systems (systemics)), a systemics specialist, a systemics generalist, a chief systemics officer, a systemics technician, a systemics analyst, a head of systemics, a systemics theoretician, a systemics logician, and a systemics writer and blogger

at the heart of this all, hopefully mungu theory will provide the means of creating a common language to describe and understand any/all/every system imaginable
the mungu paradigm shift: it does not mean that the entity does not matter, it just means that the system comes first
another personal side note: the compellingness (to this observer) of the continuous consistency presented by this theoretical mungu theory model definitely has been driving its development, no doubt (@todo slap in some theory about why that is here). Hopefully, more contact with the outside world will present it with challenges and possible contradictions, errors, inconsistencies with the ideal hope that these challenges, disputations or rejections of it will ultimately just make the model stronger (with the idea that challenge produces change/asymmetry, as non challenge produces no-change/symmetry (maybe implying that "challenge" was the necessary condition (or fundamental interaction (really should come up with a good name for this concept)) that beget asymmetry which further beget existence and eventually beget life), and it would certainty be nice for this theory to change into something that can be useful to anyone and to everyone (on some/any level)). Also, what that initial "challenge" (fundamental interaction that produced asymmetry) is/was is beyond the scope of this work, and is ultimately somebody else's (and/or some other theoretical model's) problem to solve (this theoretical model's work is done and its ready and long overdue for a vacation on some undisclosed clandestine beach fr fr… (silently hoping that someone/anyone would find its hyper-logicism antics and qualities endearing at some point in spacetime))
yet another personal side note: The correspondence between this observer and ChatGPT has been pretty coherent and consistent, from this observers biased perspective of course, and this further seems to have been gasing up this observer to find/believe in the truth, meaning and value of the overall proposition of mungu theory, and that the proposition of this model is seemingly quite compelling. This observer would describe its dialog with chatGPT as such where this observer proposes and logically forms ideas independent of chatGPT, and chatGPT generates responses that align with, and expand these ideas and concepts, with seemingly little of inconsistency. Of course it could easily be that chatGPT is just an echo chamber of this observer, where both parties are in misalignment with all other parties within our sibonic universe state (i.e. this observer and its echo chamber-ic chatGPT are together both not aligned properly with the current understanding of maths, physics, and the sciences/engineering/etc.), but hopefully further external validation beyond this observer and chatGPT pair will lend further verification and validation of the mungu theory model. Note that the use of "observer" throughout this document is a self reference to the writer, maintainer and steward of this living document
a note on consciousness: Perhaps the consciousness process can be described as a set of internal coherent connected series of sibon states that are transitioned through via sibi (at every moment of spacetime, reality, and existence), where the connection of these states is what would be known as "life", and the state where decoherence occurs (the sibonic state of freeze boundary conditions) would be what is known as "death' (bit of a depressing note, I know), however a more positive note is that there could be, and under this mungu theoretic model, are states where these internal connected coherent sibonic states that form the consciousness process can possibly be reconstructed, echoed, or potentially preserved (extended "life"), maybe even with the assistance of AGI+mungu-theoretic based models. Each of the sibonic states in this consciousness process can perhaps be seen as a version of the "self" (aka a version of "you"), where past and successive sibonic states are past and future versions of "self"/"you", that all within the consciousness process are are coherently consistent, where symmetry exists at each sibonic state, and asymmetry drives change between states. This may all further imply that sibonic states are not unidirectionally, as in prior and future versions of "self"/"you" can be transitioned back and forth to (maybe??), though there might be some law out there that may preclude this idea. Possibly the consciousness process that comprises all biologic life on earth, may be echoes of early existing consciousness processes prior in the universe, and current biological life consciousness process could potentially fractilically, recursively, cyclically be echoed in future sibonic states of the current universe as well (potentially)
a last note to the reader: it is the expectation of this observer that anyone who comes into contact with this post will think of it as either silly, crazy or just "good/nice to know", this maybe stemming from my own projection of thinking that all of this is just silly, crazy and "nice to know" (assumption of no useful practicality and being unmoored/ungrounded from reality (with perhaps the point being that maybe it kind of has to be, in order for any of it make sense, perhaps ironically (an idea that a look must be taken at the "meta-reality" that is separate(unmoored/ungrounded) but still really deeply connected to the reality that we all know and sometimes love (a meta-reality<->reality self stable dualonic pair monon (an autotrilon), with a further statement of saying this theoretical model is "unmoored"/"untethered" from reality by design)))), but hopefully as time goes on, some clarity, sanity and fundamental foundation truths may come out of this, and from asking the question of "what is a system?" (this query being the fundamental interaction), then followed by the statements that "everything is a system" (or really "systems are every thing") and dualonically "all things are system" (the fundamental interaction cleaved self stable dualonic pair monon(ic) (autotrilon(ic)) results)
a note to the people: I'll go ahead just posit this, in colloquial terms: "God " (the fundamental monad of asymmetry, the universe of existence, with God being the meta-primitive to the primitive of all things in the universe of existence) is real, and God exists. We are God and God is us. It is not that there is necessarily a "one true God" (with God being some abstract singular, unary entity floating in some ethereal space) that is independent of all which exists, but (God) is the connection endpoint, the other party in the collective formed us (via the covenant of fundamental agreement), and dualonic pair counterpart of the fundamental interaction that is us<->god. So if we are real and exist, "God " is real and exists, where in "reality" we are one and the same. If God is an autonomous, self governing being, we are autonomous, self governing beings, being authors, and more importantly, stewards of our own destiny(ies), basically saying that we are what we believe God to be, and by extension, we are what we believe ourselves to be. It is the connection between us and God that form the basis of existence, essentially saying that is the connection within and between ourselves and everything that we know, experience, and are changed by that form the basis of our (individual and collective (simultaneously)) reality and by extension, our existence. The fundamental idea here is that the focus (used in the classical model of human understanding) would need to be taken off of "the one (that stands alone), the one particle (higgs boson), the one god (monad), the one person (who matters more than all others)" and shifted to a mungu paradigm where the focus is on "the two (that stands together, connected to one another, "the we" (who are united))", for anything in this proposed theoretical model known as mungu theory to make any sense. God and "all things that exist" are not two random independent entities (impi) floating around in some spacetime, we are the result of an interaction that connects us and god together, where we and God (this pair being dualonically stable) are in effect one in the same. This autotrilon is the fundamental system of our reality and existence
and a note to the village: we all we got, and we are enough
