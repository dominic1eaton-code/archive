If you want, I can generate any of the following from this:

📌 A **Notion OKR Dashboard Template** (CSV/Markdown)
📌 A **Mermaid Timeline + OKR heatmap**
📌 A **Board-ready PDF scorecard**

Just tell me which one!

Here’s a **clear, actionable explanation** of what the terms in your Year-2 Forecast (events, collabs, works, summits, cohorts) *actually refer to in your ecosystem*, grounded in the context of your models (UCGP, Ashe Cycle, UPE, Ubuntuwa Commons, venture coop ecosystem, etc.) — not vague concepts.

---

## 📌 **1) Events**

**What they are:**
Structured interactions (virtual or in-person) designed to educate, engage, or onboard stakeholders across your ecosystem.

**Examples & Purpose**

* **Webinars** — Training sessions on Governance OS, Intake SOPs, or legal essentials for cooperatives
* **Workshops** — Hands-on guided sessions with client coops (ex: “Running Council Workflows”)
* **AMA Panels** — *Ask Me Anything* style sessions with you & stewards to build community trust
* **Product Demos** — Presentations for partners/clients on capabilities of Governance OS or Analytics
* **Onboarding Bootcamps** — Multi-day structured orientation for new coops

**Who participates:**
Clients, stewards, boards/councils, partners, researchers, community members.

**Outcomes measured by:**
attendance, engagement score, post-event adoption, training completion.

---

## 📌 **2) Collaborations (Collabs)**

**What they are:**
Formalized partnerships with external entities that contribute mutual value, produce outputs together, or expand ecosystem reach.

**Types of Collaborations**

* **Research Collabs** (e.g., with systemics researchers, universities, think-tanks)

  * Joint whitepapers on complex systems / ecosystem governance
  * Shared frameworks for cooperative autonomy/AI interop
* **Technology Partnerships**

Organized groups of cooperatives, ventures, or participants that move through *sequenced programs* together — with shared learning, governance standards, and operational milestones.

### Core uses in Year-2:

**A) Cooperative Cohorts**

* Groups of new coops onboarded together
* Structured progression:
  ► **Intake & Foundation**
  ► **Governance Adoption**
  ► **Operational Scaling**
* Examples:

  * **Cohort #1:** First wave (Nandi, Wolof, Dogon)
  * **Cohort #2:** Next wave: Azande, Lomwe, Damara
  * **Cohort #3:** Later wave: Niguvu, San, Massai

**B) Programmatic Cohorts**

* Learner-oriented groups in structured programs (like *Kano, Ndebe, Kuzu, Zalendo, Zamba, Luma*)

  * Each cohort completes a thematic cycle:
    — governance bootcamp
    — platform adoption sprint
    — shared metrics reviews

**C) Adoption Cohorts**

* Groups migrating to new capabilities (v2 tooling, analytics) together

**Outputs**

* Group commitments to standards
* Shared KPIs
* Peer review circles
* Compounded adoption velocity

---

## 📌 **How They Fit Together (Narrative + ROI)**

If you want, I can also generate **template definitions** for each of these (e.g., “Event Charter Template”, “Collaboration MoU template”, “Summit Playbook”, “Cohort Curriculum Blueprint”). Just say which one!

Here are **template definitions** for the key constructs in your Year-2 ecosystem. You can use these as **foundational document artifacts** to standardize how events, collaborations, summits, cohorts, and associated outputs are defined, scoped, and executed.

Each template below includes **purpose, scope, components, roles, timeline/steps, and success criteria.** You can copy these into your OGD, Notion, SOP library, or legal docs and customize per initiative.

## 📌 **Tips After Import**

📅 **Color-code** calendars for:
• Sprint activities
• Personal deep work
• Narrative
• Legal/formation events
• Client onboarding
• Agile rituals

🔔 **Set reminders** (email / popup) for critical deadlines.

📍 **Add Zoom links / physical locations** after import.

---

If you want, I can also turn this into:

📌 A **Mermaid Gantt visualization**

📌 A **Notion board CSV**

📌 A **Time-blocked weekly template** (Monday → Sunday calendar blocks)

Just tell me which one you want!

Absolutely — I can generate a **Google Calendar CSV** that includes **every item in your Year-1 WBS hierarchy** (WBS → Packages → Themes → Initiatives → Epics → Stories), **federated agile rituals**, **personal timeblocks**, **client and legal events**, **milestones**, **narrative posts**, and **meetings/appointments**.

Because your Year-1 WBS is very large and deeply hierarchical, I’ll produce the **complete CSV content in manageable segments** and then provide a **single downloadable block** at the end (so you can import it all at once into Google Calendar). To ensure this is perfectly comprehensive and aligned with your structure, we’ll follow this pattern:

1. **Calendar Fields**

   * Subject
   * Start Date
   * Start Time
   * End Date
   * End Time
   * Description
   * Location

2. **Categories Included**

   * WBS items (all levels tagged in the Subject)
   * Agile rituals (daily standups, weekly planning, sprint ceremonies)
   * Personal deep work blocks and reviews
   * Legal events (entity filings, confirmations)
   * Client coop formation & onboarding
   * Narrative deliverables (Mungu/Meridian blogs)
   * Milestones

---

## 📌 **Before I generate the CSV**

I need **one small clarification** so the output is properly scoped and labeled:

### **QUESTION:**

For your WBS items, how should the **calendar event title** format encode the hierarchy?

Choose one of the following:

#### 1️⃣ **Full Hierarchy in Title**

```
<WBS ID> — <Package> — <Theme> — <Initiative> — <Epic> — <Story Name>
```

Example:

```
S-0001 (Feature) — P-0001 — TH-0001 — I-0001 — E-0001 — Setup Tooling & Accounts
```

#### 2️⃣ **Shortened with Tags**

```
<WBS ID> — <Story Name> [P-0001 | TH-0001 | I-0001 | E-0001]
```

#### 3️⃣ **Minimal**

```
<Story Name> — <WBS ID>
```

Reply with **1**, **2**, or **3**.

---

### 📝 IMPORTANT

Once you pick the title **format**, I’ll produce:

✅ A **single CSV file** covering **all 12 months** for Year-1
✅ All WBS items you defined previously
✅ All meetings/appointments/rituals
✅ All deep work and owner labels in the calendar subject/description

Example snippet you’ll get after choosing:

```
Subject,Start Date,Start Time,End Date,End Time,Description,Location
W-0001 — Firm Year 1 Delivery Roadmap (Strategy) — Monthly Delivery,01/01/2026,09:00 AM,01/01/2026,10:00 AM,All work to get clients live by year end,

```

---

### 🧠 Guideline for Your Answer

Please reply with **only a number**:

```
1
```

or

```
2
```

or

```
3
```

That will tell me how to format your WBS items in the calendar event titles.

---

Reply with **1, 2, or 3** and I’ll generate the full **Google Calendar import CSV** accordingly.

Awesome — you chose **format (3)**:

```
<Story Name> — <WBS ID>
```

So calendar events will show **just the story / deliverable name and WBS ID** as the event title.

Below is your **Year-1 Google Calendar import CSV** (complete personal WBS + agile rituals + legal/client events + deep-work timeblocks + narrative posts + meetings).
This is a **full file** — copy it into a file called:

📌 **year1_personal_wbs_calendar.csv**

and import it into **Google Calendar → Settings → Import**.

## 🎁 Optional Enhancements

I can also generate:

📌 **Mermaid Gantt from this calendar**
