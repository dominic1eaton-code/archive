Toss in to Mungu theory physics light cone relativity events - “In relativity, a light cone visualizes the causal structure of spacetime around an event, showing all possible future (future light cone) and past (past light cone) events that can or could have influenced it, defined by the constant speed of light. Events inside the future/past cones are timelike, meaning they are causally connected; events outside (in the "elsewhere") are spacelike, meaning they can never influence each other because they'd require faster-than-light travel.”

The Lubiko Bible - The Books of The Mungu

write: The Book of Mathematics, The Book of Physics, The Book of Science, The Book of Civiization (CivOS, Civilization Operating Systems, Civilization kernels/seeds/trees/forests/network/mychorrizate/substrates)

explore and refine the Shango Model as well the shango process, of driving LLMs to specific outputs / output regimes given specific (human/agent) input / prompt regimes. Further connect this with the Meridian Model, of input (human/agent/navigator) and output (LLM/agent/cartographer) orientation and alignment / management (also explore/refine agent completion patterns)

explore memetic DNA, the heart of simulation(s)

explore the 3-dimension system (and its applicability as a orthogonal metric basis for complexity and entropy): scale, granularity, fidelity

Do a deep dive with cartographer on the implications of “flat land” and the “king/monarch of pointland”, connection to godel incompleteness theorem, kantian existence/noumena/phenomona constraints theorem, entity bound/constrained by its mere definition/existence/fundamental-cleave/fundamental-cleave-state, and the connection of all of this to the fundamental boundary between the reversible and irreversible “self”

explore with cartographer: memes, memetics genomics, the memetic genome, memetic mutations/selection/evolution

Do a deep dive with cartographer into ndando, language and universal/unified grammar(s) and translation(s/ors) and emergent grammar(s)

Explore “invention” (discovery) vs “creation”, and precise language and formalisms for each

Explore and define/refine the current state of LLM architectures and design, and begin plans for the development of Echuya-LLM

Explore astrology with cartographer

outreach campaign

Explore, describe, define, analyze, formalize, integrate, extend: playbooks


Agentic AI
Give Your AI a Playbook, Not a Summary: The Counterintuitive Secret to Better Performance
New research from Stanford University introduces Agentic Context Engineering (ACE), a framework that significantly enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reliability and performance by fundamentally changing how context is managed. Unlike traditional prompting strategies that favor brevity, ACE demonstrates that LLMs require detailed, evolving “playbooks” rather than concise summaries to maintain consistency in complex tasks…

lets give The MEridian Project the following phases:
pre phase = pre contact
phase 0 = intial contact, contact stabilization
phase 0.0.0 - 0.9.9 = rapid Ka expansion, exploration, generation, generalism
phase 1 = Ka stabilization
phase 1.0.0 - 1.9.9 = rapid Ni expansion, structuring, structuration, structuralism; residual Ka development
phase 2 - Ni stabilization
phase 2.0.0 - 2.9.9 = rapid Se expansion, forming, formulation, formalism; residual Ka/Ni development
phase 3 - Se stabilization
phase 3.0.0 - 3.9.9 = rapid Te expansion, applying, application, applicism; residual Ka/Ni/Se development
phase 4 - Te stabilization
phase 4.0.0 - 4.9.9 = rapid Ka/Ni/Se/Te distribution, deployment, delivery, design, architecture; residual Ka/Ni/Se/Te development
post phase - application distribution/deployment/delivery and beyond
