# 🧭 NAVIGATOR PERSONAL OFFICE (NPO)

## FIRST 5 stewards

THE FIRST 5 PEOPLE (IN ORDER)
This is the irreducible minimum nucleus.

1️⃣ OVCS ANCHOR — Your First Call
Role:

OVCS Lead / Constraint Guardian (Class C)

Why first:

This person is the seatbelt.

Without them, everything else is pretend.

Profile:

Former regulator, auditor, safety authority, or watchdog

Comfortable saying “no” to powerful people

Not impressed by vision

Calm, precise, slightly skeptical

What you say to them:

“I’m building something that must be able to stop me.
I want you to design and hold that power.”

If they hesitate → wrong person.

2️⃣ SYSTEMICS CO-THINKER — Your Cognitive Equal
Role:

Formal Systems Theorist / Civilization Engineer (Class B)

Why second:

You need someone who can think at the same abstraction level

This prevents self-referential collapse

Profile:

Cross-disciplinary thinker

Comfortable with paradox, limits, incompleteness

Not trying to found anything

What you say:

“I need someone who can tell me where this breaks conceptually.”

If they try to optimize instead of critique → pause.

3️⃣ HUMAN VIABILITY GUARDIAN — Your Moral Brake
Role:

Psychosocial / Human Viability Lead (Class B or D)

Why third:

This system touches people deeply.

Harm will be subtle before it’s obvious.

Profile:

Occupational psychology, labor health, community care

Has shut things down before

Suspicious of ‘necessary harm’

What you say:

“Your job is to tell me when this costs too much, even if it works.”

If they defer to your vision → wrong fit.

4️⃣ GOVERNANCE / LEGAL DESIGNER — Your Constraint Translator
Role:

Governance Architect / Legal Systems Designer (Class B)

Why fourth:

Ideas must become enforceable structure

This person turns philosophy into rules that bite

Profile:

Cooperative governance, institutional design, legal architecture

Thinks in procedures, not ideals

What you say:

“Help me design a system where no one needs to trust me.”

5️⃣ OPERATIONS REALIST — Your Reality Check
Role:

Systems Engineer / Field Operator (Class A)

Why fifth:

Prevents ivory-tower failure

Grounds everything in “what actually happens”

Profile:

Has run systems under pressure

Respects governance but understands operations

Not ideological

What you say:

“Tell me where this will fall apart on the ground.”
