please give me my personal office (NPO, the Dominic Eaton Software Engineering Firm that initially consists of me, my first 8 hire team and initial 5 stewards) complete set of starting WBSs for year 1:

work breakdown structure
WBS W-XXXXXX -> packages P-XXXXXX -> themes TH-XXXXXX -> initiatives I-XXXXXX -> epics E-XXXXXX -> stories S-XXXXXX

story types: feature, blocker, enabler, capability, test, issue, bug, enhancement, case, defect, requirement, risk, vulnerability, metric, release, assessment, report, brief, documentation, custom

team types: squad, chapter, guild, tiger, tribe, line, domain

time breakdown structuress: timebox, timeblock, PI, sprint, quarter, day, month, quarter, week

roadmap structures: goal, objective, milestone, strategy, plan, outcome, tactic


in a tabular form similar to this structure:
W-0009: The Eaton Family Estate        : strategy, 2026-07-19, 1d
P-0009: Family Estate                   : plan, 2026-07-19, 1d
TH-0009: Family Estate & Boundary       : tactic, after 2026-07-19, 1d
I-0009: Estate & Firewall               : milestone, after 2026-07-19, 1d
E-0025: Estate Governance Setup         : milestone, after 2026-07-20, 1d
S-1097 (req): Draft estate governance docs           : 2026-07-20, 7d


also add columns for member and team that handles/steward/"owns" each item and generate appropriate members and teams too (and be sure to include me, my first 8 hires and 5 stewards as well)

and i would like members/teams and new/future generated members and teams to also have names that match their function/role/job/position too

can you make the table whole, not in parts, still organized according to WBS and sub breakdown structures and also make sure it has the headers of ID, name, type, brief, start, dur at least

the table should be a single, continuous table, grouped by WBSs


I would like all the WBSs that allow for this entire cycle to be booted up, live and minimal viably staffed within year 1:
ashe cycle:
    coops, coop classes, coop members
        boards, councils, members, partners, stewards, committees
        | Class       | Core Identity                          |

=========================================================================================================================

Here’s a **clear description, comparison, and contrast** of the **team types** you asked about — **squad, chapter, guild, tiger, tribe, line, and domain** — so you can see *how they function, differ, and relate* in organizational and agile team design:

---

## 🚀 **Core Team Types & Definitions**

### **1. Squad**

**Definition:** A *small, cross-functional team* focused on delivering a specific mission, product, feature, or capability. They are **autonomous** and responsible for end-to-end outcomes. ([Wrike][1])
**Typical Size:** ~6–12 members. ([Wrike][1])
**Key Traits**

* Self-organizing; decides how work gets done. ([Medium][2])
* Often includes all roles needed to deliver (dev, design, QA, etc.). ([Wrike][1])
* Works continuously on the same mission. ([Medium][2])
  **Analogy:** *Mini startup* with full responsibility for a product area. ([Medium][2])

---

### **2. Tribe**

**Definition:** A *larger grouping of squads* working in related domains or product areas. ([Wrike][1])
**Typical Size:** Up to ~100 people (aligned with social coordination limits). ([Wrike][1])
**Key Traits**

* Focuses on broader alignment across squads. ([Medium][2])
* Ensures communication and shared practices. ([Wrike][1])
* Usually oversees multiple squads in the same domain. ([Medium][2])
  **Analogy:** *Product department* under a shared mission umbrella. ([Medium][2])

**Compare vs. Squad:**
Squads are execution units; tribes are coordinating bodies for squads with similar objectives. ([Wrike][1])

---

### **3. Chapter**

**Definition:** A *horizontal grouping of specialists or roles* across squads or tribes. ([Wrike][1])
**Key Traits**

* Organized by *skill or discipline* (e.g., front-end engineers). ([Wrike][1])
* Members share best practices and standards. ([Wrike][1])
* Led by a *chapter lead* often responsible for people development (training, career growth). ([Medium][2])
  **Contrast vs. Squad:**
  Chapters aren’t about product delivery; they support consistent practices across product teams. ([Medium][2])

---

### **4. Guild**

**Definition:** An *informal, voluntary community of interest* spanning squads and tribes. ([Wrike][1])
**Key Traits**

* Organized around shared *interests or passions* (e.g., DevOps, UX). ([Wrike][1])
* Not necessarily tied to delivery or reporting structures. ([Wrike][1])
* A forum for learning, exploration, and best-practice diffusion. ([Medium][2])
  **Contrast vs. Chapter:**
  Guilds are *interest-based communities across the organization*, while Chapters are *skill-based groups within tribes*. ([Wrike][1])

---

### **5. Tiger Team**

**Definition:** A *temporary, high-impact task force* assembled to solve **urgent, specific, complex problems** or achieve high-stakes objectives. ([PM Column][3])
**Key Traits**

* Short-term and *goal-specific* — disbanded once mission is done. ([Tempo.io][4])
* Composed of *cross-disciplinary experts*. ([PM Column][3])
* Works with minimal oversight and high autonomy. ([Wikipedia][5])
  **Contrast to Squads:**
  Squads have *ongoing missions* — tiger teams exist only for *acute problem resolution*. ([Tempo.io][4])

---

### **6. Line (Team)**

**Context:**
“Line” or *line team* typically refers to a *functional or reporting group* in a traditional organizational hierarchy. Not specific to Agile but common in hybrid models.

**Key Characteristics**

* Usually organized around *business functions* or expertise (e.g., engineering line, sales line). ([and.digital][6])
* Provides performance management, promotions, and career progression. ([Medium][2])
* Members can be in a *line team* while also belonging to squads, chapters, etc. ([Medium][2])
  **Contrast:**
  Line teams focus on *career & people management*, not delivery workflows or missions.

---

### **7. Domain Team**

**Definition:** A group organized around a *specific technical or business domain* where their focus is on *ongoing domain expertise and long-term accountability*.

**Characteristics**

* Often seen in domain-driven design or *Team Topologies* frameworks (not strictly agile squads).
* Team membership is based on domain responsibility (e.g., payments team, identity team).
* They manage APIs/services in that domain and ensure consistency and ownership of domain boundaries.

**Contrast vs. Squad:**
Domain teams can serve as *organizational groupings with long-term stewardship* of a domain, while squads are *mission-oriented delivery units*.

---

## 📊 **Comparison Summary**

| **Team Type**   | **Primary Focus**                       | **Duration**        | **Scope**              | **Typical Use Case**                    |                                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Squad**       | Execution of product/features           | Ongoing             | Product mission        | Rapid delivery teams ([Medium][2])      |                                |
| **Tribe**       | Coordination of squads                  | Long-term           | Product area           | Cross-functional alignment ([Wrike][1]) |                                |
| **Chapter**     | Skill/domain expertise                  | Long-term           | Functional consistency | Best practice sharing ([Wrike][1])      |                                |
| **Guild**       | Cross-organizational interest community | Long-term/voluntary | Broad interests        | Knowledge exchange ([Wrike][1])         |                                |
| **Tiger Team**  | Critical problem resolution             | Short-term          | Specific target        | High-impact issues ([PM Column][3])     |                                |
| **Line Team**   | Functional hierarchy                    | Ongoing             | Career & reporting     | People management ([and.digital][6])    |                                |
| **Domain Team** | Domain accountability                   | Ongoing             | Domain services        | Domain ownership & APIs                 | *conceptual industry practice* |

---

## 🧠 **How They Work Together**

* **Squads** deliver value day-to-day; **tribes** keep them aligned across larger goals. ([Wrike][1])
* **Chapters** ensure technical and skill consistency *across squads* while **guilds** allow broad interest collaboration. ([Medium][2])
* **Line teams** (HR/functional reporting) support career paths, distinct from delivery responsibilities. ([Medium][2])
* **Tiger teams** are called in *only when problems require concentrated, high-expert effort*. ([Tempo.io][4])
* **Domain teams** exist in some models where domain ownership persists beyond single product missions.

---

## 🧩 **Practical Example (Spotify-Inspired)**

* A **squad** builds feature A. ([Wrike][1])
* Multiple squads form a **tribe** responsible for the product area (e.g., mobile). ([Medium][2])
* Engineers with the same specialty across squads group in a **chapter** (e.g., front-end). ([Wrike][1])
* Engineers across the company interested in DevOps form a **guild**. ([Wrike][1])
* When a major outage occurs, a **tiger team** is stood up. ([Tempo.io][4])
* All developers remain part of their **line team** for performance reviews. ([Medium][2])
* Some organizations add **domain teams** for long-term domain ownership.

If you’d like, I can also map these *team types to specific roles* in your federation/org design (e.g., which team type suits which entity or project), or show how these teams interact with lifecycles like Ashe/Msingi.

4️⃣ GOVERNANCE / LEGAL DESIGNER — Your Constraint Translator
Role:

Governance Architect / Legal Systems Designer (Class B)

Why fourth:

Ideas must become enforceable structure

This person turns philosophy into rules that bite
