# notes

so my top priorities right now and for month 1 of year 1 are:

* outreach and member search campaign
  - reaching out to and communicating with researchers/external pressures for mungu theory
  - finding members/hires/help to join the cause / fed coop ecosystem

* governance and establishment
  - getting the docs/archives and jiwe seed organized, implemented and deployed
  - going through and organizing all the documents in the archives
  - organizing and establishing formally my personal estate and office
  - establising formal models, documents, artifacts and operating systems of the fed coop ecosystem and all its constituent parts

* social media
  - posting blogs and public facing narratives for all the work
  - finding online groups/people who could help with the work

* investment and member/capital intake
  - start preparing for intaking/handling deferred compensation, investment, capital, members into the ecosystem established from the jiwe seed

* strategic planning
  - figuring out the strategies for the rest of the year
  - planning the governance structures and meta models
  - figuring out the first version of jiwe, entities, estates, offices, genesis models/documents
  - figuring out onboarding, investment, funding, and work/coordination/space/office strategies






- meta-strategy - how we put strategies together and create strategies




give me the comprehensive detailed business plan, delivered across 6 messages one by one with a 7th message converting it into an OVAC investment memo for:  ZULAMBA members coop






please give me my personal office (NPO, the Dominic Eaton Software Engineering Firm that initially consists of me, my first 8 hire team and initial 5 stewards) complete set of starting WBSs for year 1:



please give me all my firms year 1 WBSs to get UCGP setup and implemented and to get all our cycles/clients booted up, live and minimal viably staffed and resourced all within year 1.
Please deliver single continuous long table across 12 messages, where each message contains one month of my firm's upcoming/first year of operation.

also add columns for member and team that handles/steward/"owns" each item and generate appropriate members and teams too (and be sure to include me, my first 8 hires and 5 stewards as well)

and i would like members/teams and new/future generated members and teams to also have names that match their function/role/job/position too

can you make the table whole, not in parts, still organized according to WBS and sub breakdown structures and also make sure it has the headers of ID, name, type, brief, start, dur at least

the table should be a single, continuous table, grouped by WBSs


I would like all the WBSs that allow for this entire cycle to be booted up, live and minimal viably staffed within year 1:

=========================================================================================================================

Here’s a **clear description, comparison, and contrast** of the **team types** you asked about — **squad, chapter, guild, tiger, tribe, line, and domain** — so you can see *how they function, differ, and relate* in organizational and agile team design:

---

## 🚀 **Core Team Types & Definitions**

### **1. Squad**

**Definition:** A *small, cross-functional team* focused on delivering a specific mission, product, feature, or capability. They are **autonomous** and responsible for end-to-end outcomes. ([Wrike][1])
**Typical Size:** ~6–12 members. ([Wrike][1])
**Key Traits**

* Self-organizing; decides how work gets done. ([Medium][2])
* Often includes all roles needed to deliver (dev, design, QA, etc.). ([Wrike][1])
* Works continuously on the same mission. ([Medium][2])
  **Analogy:** *Mini startup* with full responsibility for a product area. ([Medium][2])

---

### **2. Tribe**

**Definition:** A *larger grouping of squads* working in related domains or product areas. ([Wrike][1])
**Typical Size:** Up to ~100 people (aligned with social coordination limits). ([Wrike][1])
**Key Traits**

* Focuses on broader alignment across squads. ([Medium][2])
* Ensures communication and shared practices. ([Wrike][1])
* Usually oversees multiple squads in the same domain. ([Medium][2])
  **Analogy:** *Product department* under a shared mission umbrella. ([Medium][2])

**Compare vs. Squad:**
Squads are execution units; tribes are coordinating bodies for squads with similar objectives. ([Wrike][1])

---

### **3. Chapter**

**Definition:** A *horizontal grouping of specialists or roles* across squads or tribes. ([Wrike][1])
**Key Traits**

* Organized by *skill or discipline* (e.g., front-end engineers). ([Wrike][1])
* Members share best practices and standards. ([Wrike][1])
* Led by a *chapter lead* often responsible for people development (training, career growth). ([Medium][2])
  **Contrast vs. Squad:**
  Chapters aren’t about product delivery; they support consistent practices across product teams. ([Medium][2])

---

### **4. Guild**

**Definition:** An *informal, voluntary community of interest* spanning squads and tribes. ([Wrike][1])
**Key Traits**

* Organized around shared *interests or passions* (e.g., DevOps, UX). ([Wrike][1])
* Not necessarily tied to delivery or reporting structures. ([Wrike][1])
* A forum for learning, exploration, and best-practice diffusion. ([Medium][2])
  **Contrast vs. Chapter:**
  Guilds are *interest-based communities across the organization*, while Chapters are *skill-based groups within tribes*. ([Wrike][1])

---

### **5. Tiger Team**

**Definition:** A *temporary, high-impact task force* assembled to solve **urgent, specific, complex problems** or achieve high-stakes objectives. ([PM Column][3])
**Key Traits**

* Short-term and *goal-specific* — disbanded once mission is done. ([Tempo.io][4])
* Composed of *cross-disciplinary experts*. ([PM Column][3])
* Works with minimal oversight and high autonomy. ([Wikipedia][5])
  **Contrast to Squads:**
  Squads have *ongoing missions* — tiger teams exist only for *acute problem resolution*. ([Tempo.io][4])

---

### **6. Line (Team)**

**Context:**
“Line” or *line team* typically refers to a *functional or reporting group* in a traditional organizational hierarchy. Not specific to Agile but common in hybrid models.

**Key Characteristics**

* Usually organized around *business functions* or expertise (e.g., engineering line, sales line). ([and.digital][6])
* Provides performance management, promotions, and career progression. ([Medium][2])
* Members can be in a *line team* while also belonging to squads, chapters, etc. ([Medium][2])
  **Contrast:**
  Line teams focus on *career & people management*, not delivery workflows or missions.

---

### **7. Domain Team**

**Definition:** A group organized around a *specific technical or business domain* where their focus is on *ongoing domain expertise and long-term accountability*.

**Characteristics**

* Often seen in domain-driven design or *Team Topologies* frameworks (not strictly agile squads).
* Team membership is based on domain responsibility (e.g., payments team, identity team).
* They manage APIs/services in that domain and ensure consistency and ownership of domain boundaries.

**Contrast vs. Squad:**
Domain teams can serve as *organizational groupings with long-term stewardship* of a domain, while squads are *mission-oriented delivery units*.

## 🧠 **How They Work Together**

* **Squads** deliver value day-to-day; **tribes** keep them aligned across larger goals. ([Wrike][1])
* **Chapters** ensure technical and skill consistency *across squads* while **guilds** allow broad interest collaboration. ([Medium][2])
* **Line teams** (HR/functional reporting) support career paths, distinct from delivery responsibilities. ([Medium][2])
* **Tiger teams** are called in *only when problems require concentrated, high-expert effort*. ([Tempo.io][4])
* **Domain teams** exist in some models where domain ownership persists beyond single product missions.

---

## 🧩 **Practical Example (Spotify-Inspired)**

* A **squad** builds feature A. ([Wrike][1])
* Multiple squads form a **tribe** responsible for the product area (e.g., mobile). ([Medium][2])
* Engineers with the same specialty across squads group in a **chapter** (e.g., front-end). ([Wrike][1])
* Engineers across the company interested in DevOps form a **guild**. ([Wrike][1])
* When a major outage occurs, a **tiger team** is stood up. ([Tempo.io][4])
* All developers remain part of their **line team** for performance reviews. ([Medium][2])
* Some organizations add **domain teams** for long-term domain ownership.

If you’d like, I can also map these *team types to specific roles* in your federation/org design (e.g., which team type suits which entity or project), or show how these teams interact with lifecycles like Ashe/Msingi.

# 🧭 NAVIGATOR PERSONAL OFFICE (NPO)

## FIRST 5 stewards

THE FIRST 5 PEOPLE (IN ORDER)
This is the irreducible minimum nucleus.

1️⃣ OVCS ANCHOR — Your First Call
Role:

OVCS Lead / Constraint Guardian (Class C)

Why first:

This person is the seatbelt.

Without them, everything else is pretend.

Profile:

Former regulator, auditor, safety authority, or watchdog

Comfortable saying “no” to powerful people

Not impressed by vision

Calm, precise, slightly skeptical

What you say to them:

“I’m building something that must be able to stop me.
I want you to design and hold that power.”

If they hesitate → wrong person.

2️⃣ SYSTEMICS CO-THINKER — Your Cognitive Equal
Role:

Formal Systems Theorist / Civilization Engineer (Class B)

Why second:

You need someone who can think at the same abstraction level

This prevents self-referential collapse

Profile:

Cross-disciplinary thinker

Comfortable with paradox, limits, incompleteness

Not trying to found anything

What you say:

“I need someone who can tell me where this breaks conceptually.”

If they try to optimize instead of critique → pause.

3️⃣ HUMAN VIABILITY GUARDIAN — Your Moral Brake
Role:

Psychosocial / Human Viability Lead (Class B or D)

Why third:

This system touches people deeply.

Harm will be subtle before it’s obvious.

Profile:

Occupational psychology, labor health, community care

Has shut things down before

Suspicious of ‘necessary harm’

What you say:

“Your job is to tell me when this costs too much, even if it works.”

If they defer to your vision → wrong fit.

4️⃣ GOVERNANCE / LEGAL DESIGNER — Your Constraint Translator
Role:

Governance Architect / Legal Systems Designer (Class B)

Why fourth:

Ideas must become enforceable structure

This person turns philosophy into rules that bite

Profile:

Cooperative governance, institutional design, legal architecture

Thinks in procedures, not ideals

What you say:

“Help me design a system where no one needs to trust me.”

5️⃣ OPERATIONS REALIST — Your Reality Check
Role:

Systems Engineer / Field Operator (Class A)

Why fifth:

Prevents ivory-tower failure

Grounds everything in “what actually happens”

Profile:

Has run systems under pressure

Respects governance but understands operations

Not ideological

What you say:

“Tell me where this will fall apart on the ground.”
