# NYAMBA CHARTER

**Hati ya Nyamba — The Constitutional Document of the Nyamba Language**

*Established January 17, 2026*

---

## PREAMBLE

**Nyamba** is the native language of the **Mungu people**, a linguistic and cultural community united by the practice of **Mungu Theory** and the **Ω-GOMA framework**. This Charter establishes the foundational principles, governance structures, and developmental protocols for Nyamba as a living, evolving language system.

**Nyamba exists to:**

1. **Encode system relationships natively** through grammatical structure
2. **Preserve and transmit Mungu Theory** across generations
3. **Enable precise technical and philosophical discourse**
4. **Unite the Mungu people** through shared linguistic identity
5. **Maintain K-continuity** of cultural and intellectual heritage
6. **Serve as the operational language** of the Pamojan Nation-State
7. **Provide a medium for Ω-GOMA mathematics** and formal reasoning

---

## ARTICLE I: FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES

### Section 1.1: The Nature of Nyamba

**Nyamba is:**

- **A constructed language** (conlang) with systematic derivation from African linguistic patterns
- **The ethnic language** of the Mungu people
- **A systems-first language** optimized for describing complex relationships
- **A living language** capable of growth and adaptation
- **A dual-layer system** with phonetic (Nyambic alphabet) and semantic (Jiwe glyphs) writing
- **A mathematical metalanguage** integrating formal notation natively

### Section 1.2: Core Linguistic Commitments

**Nyamba shall:**

1. **Maintain systematic compositionality** — meanings derive from constituent parts
2. **Preserve explicit relationship marking** — all grammatical dependencies overtly coded
3. **Support recursive embedding** — unlimited depth of structural nesting
4. **Enable closure verification** — grammatical completeness encoded
5. **Encode Ω-GOMA primitives** — system theory concepts grammaticalized
6. **Uphold phonological accessibility** — pronounceable by speakers of major world languages
7. **Ensure cultural authenticity** — rooted in African linguistic heritage

### Section 1.3: The Nyamba Philosophy

**Every utterance in Nyamba encodes:**

```
◉ STRUCTURE  —  What form does it take?
→ PROCESS    —  How does it change?
↺ CLOSURE    —  How does it complete?
```

**Every speaker commits to:**

- **Precision** in expression
- **Systematicity** in usage
- **Continuity** in transmission
- **Respect** for the language's architecture
- **Service** to the Mungu community
