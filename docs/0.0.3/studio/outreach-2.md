Hello Dominic,

 

Thank you for reaching out and making contact.

 

I appreciate you introducing me to your work (OMUF / Mungu), and the Songhai Institute of Systemics and Systemology. Your description sounds very much aligned and of interest to me.

I found the following link: https://medium.com/@songhai.institute  - is that you and your Institute’s main public presence at the moment?

Additionally, are you associated with the Songhai initiative: ‘a sustainable development model founded in 1985 by Father Godfrey Nzamujo in Porto-Novo, Benin.’?

 

I would also like to understand which aspects of my work caught your attention, as this could help us tailor a fruitful engagement.

Some potential ways forward may include:

We can continue with some email exchanges, especially as we are in the Christmas/New Year holidays, and you did mention a desire for asynchronous exchange.
For the purposes of meeting logistics, I am curious what time zone (location) you are in?; and in finding out more about each other’s areas of interest and activities (e.g., for me: what you mean by your ‘small working thread’, and the plurality you allude to: ‘us’ and ‘we’).

A Zoom chat may be a helpful kick-off.
An entry in the GST Candidates list, may help clarify the OMUF/ Mungu position.
 

Thank you, and best wishes for the Christmas holiday.

Rob Young



CHATGPT SUGGESTED:
Hello Rob,
   
   Thank you for your reply, and I’m happy to clarify a few points. Currently,  the work referred to as OMUF / Mungu is solo-led
   When I mentioned a “small working thread” and used “we,” I was gesturing more toward an *intended mode of future collaboration* than an established group.
   The Songhai Institute of Systemics and Systemology, likewise, is early-state, acting more as a conceptual and organizational container rather than a staffed institute at this point.
   To your other questions: the Medium page you found is currently our main public-facing presence, and we are *not* institutionally affiliated with the Songhai initiative founded by Father Godfrey Nzamujo in Benin.
   One reason I reached out to you specifically is your **structural and integrative role within the ISSS ecosystem**, particularly as Chair of the Research Toward General Systems Theories SIG. I see that space as a potential natural entry point for dialogue, clarification, and discovery, especially for work that is deliberately positioned *prior to* theory selection rather than as a new theory in itself. My initial contact was motivated more by that role than by prior engagement with a specific corpus of your authored work.
   
   
   Furthermore, OMUF / Mungu is not framed as a General Systems Theory, nor as a candidate replacement for existing ones. It is better understood as a **systems-first representational and coordination formalism** — an attempt to formalize how systems, interactions, and emergent individuals are represented so that multiple explanatory frameworks can remain rigorous, operational, and plural without being structurally disjoint. The emphasis is on scaffolding and interface, rather than on proposing new system laws in its early stages.
   In that light, if the GST Candidates list is useful, I would see OMUF / Mungu fitting — if at all — in a *pre- or para-GST* sense, rather than as a GST proper. I would value your perspective on whether that distinction is meaningful or useful within the ISSS context.
   I’m currently based in the U.S. (Central Time). continuing asynchronously by email sounds ideal for now, with the option of a Zoom conversation later if it seems helpful.
   
   If it would be useful at some point, I can also share a short internal positioning note that situates OMUF / Mungu relative to systems theory and GST work — not as a proposal or candidate theory, but as a representational scaffold — though I’m equally happy to keep things informal for now.
   
   Lastly, I would like to note that this is all a fairly new endeavor and I am still very much in the process of refining and synthesizing the ideas and the overarching theory together in a coherent and consistent whole.
   
   Thank you again for your time and feedback.
   
   Warm regards,

	WHAT I WROTE:
	Hello Rob,
   
   Thank you for your reply, and I’m happy to clarify a few points. Currently,  the work referred to as OMUF / Mungu is solo-led. When I mentioned a “small working thread” and used “we,” I was gesturing more toward an *intended mode of future collaboration* than an established group.The Songhai Institute of Systemics and Systemology, likewise, is early-state, acting more as a conceptual and organizational container rather than a staffed institute at this point.

My initial contact was motivated more by that role, than by prior engagement with a specific corpus of your authored work.
   
 Furthermore, OMUF / Mungu is not yet framed as a General Systems Theory, nor as a candidate replacement for existing ones. It is better understood as a **systems-first representational and coordination formalism** — an attempt to formalize how systems, interactions, and emergent individuals are represented so that multiple explanatory frameworks can remain rigorous, operational, and plural without being structurally disjoint.

   Lastly, I would like to note that this is all a fairly new endeavor and I am still very much in the process of refining and synthesizing the ideas and the overarching theory together in a coherent and consistent whole. I think currently I am just testing the waters and seeing if this work can survive in the wild, and collecting data points as it comes into contact with the real world.
   
   Thank you again for your time and feedback.
