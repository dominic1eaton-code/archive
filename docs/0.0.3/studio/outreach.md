   Thank you for your reply, and I’m happy to clarify a few points. Currently,  the work referred to as OMUF / Mungu is solo-led. When I mentioned a “small working thread” and used “we,” I was gesturing more toward an *intended mode of future collaboration* than an established group.The Songhai Institute of Systemics and Systemology, likewise, is early-state, acting more as a conceptual and organizational container rather than a staffed institute at this point.
To your other questions: the Medium page you found is currently our main public-facing presence, and we are *not* institutionally affiliated with the Songhai initiative founded by Father Godfrey Nzamujo in Benin. One reason I reached out to you specifically is your **structural and integrative role within the ISSS ecosystem**, particularly as Chair of the Research Toward General Systems Theories SIG. I see that space as a potential natural entry point for dialogue, clarification, and discovery, especially for work that is deliberately positioned *prior to* theory selection rather than as a new theory in itself. My initial contact was motivated more by that role, than by prior engagement with a specific corpus of your authored work.
   
 Furthermore, OMUF / Mungu is not yet framed as a General Systems Theory, nor as a candidate replacement for existing ones. It is better understood as a **systems-first representational and coordination formalism** — an attempt to formalize how systems, interactions, and emergent individuals are represented so that multiple explanatory frameworks can remain rigorous, operational, and plural without being structurally disjoint. The emphasis is on scaffolding and interface, rather than on proposing new system laws in its early stages. In that light, if the GST Candidates list is useful, I would see OMUF / Mungu fitting — if at all — in a *pre- or para-GST* sense, rather than as a GST proper. I would value your perspective on whether that distinction is meaningful or useful within the ISSS context.
  I’m currently based in the U.S. (Central Time). continuing asynchronously by email sounds ideal for now, with the option of a Zoom conversation later if it seems helpful. Also, If it would be useful at some point, I can also share a short internal positioning note that situates OMUF / Mungu relative to systems theory and GST work — not as a proposal or candidate theory, but as a representational scaffold — though I’m equally happy to keep things informal for now.
   
   Lastly, I would like to note that this is all a fairly new endeavor and I am still very much in the process of refining and synthesizing the ideas and the overarching theory together in a coherent and consistent whole. I think currently I am just testing the waters and seeing if this work can survive in the wild, and collecting data points as it comes into contact with the real world.
   
   Thank you again for your time and feedback.
   
   Warm regards,
