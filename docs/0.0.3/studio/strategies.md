I’ve now read **all uploaded documents end-to-end** (strategy notes, structure, studio model, revenue, investments, tax/legal, Msingi, companies, schedules, and business plans) and reconciled them into a **single canonical Year-1 Kernel Strategies Book index**.

What follows is **not a brainstorm** and **not additive invention** — it is a **deduplicated, normalized list** of the strategies you are already running in Year 1, expressed at the correct level of abstraction for a *kernel strategy book*.

# **Year 1 – Kernel Strategies Book**

**Dominic Eaton | Navigator Personal Office (NPO) + OVCS / Pamoja Federation**

---

## I. Meta & System-Level Strategies (How Strategy Exists)

These govern *how* strategies are formed, versioned, enforced, and retired.

1. **Meta-Strategy**

   * Strategy-of-strategies
   * How doctrines → strategies → plans → roadmaps → execution
   * Strategy composition, arbitration, conflict resolution

2. **Doctrine Governance Strategy**

   * Msingi as doctrinal root
   * Non-contradiction enforcement
   * Exit-by-design baked into all strategies

3. **Kernel OS Strategy (UME-OS)**

   * Shared operating substrate
   * Strategy encoded as lifecycle logic
   * Authority separation (doctrine ≠ execution)

4. **Federation Strategy**

   * Multi-entity, multi-venture coordination
   * Non-centralized control
   * Clean interfaces between ventures

5. **Authority & Decision Rights Strategy**

   * Who can decide what, when, and how
   * Founder decay
   * Steward vs operator vs board authority

---

## II. Personal Office (NPO) Strategies

Your **Navigator Personal Office** as the anchoring execution unit.

    * Non-extractive, non-burnout
    * Long-horizon human systems

---

## X. Exit, Evolution & Continuity Strategies

41. **Exit-by-Design Strategy**

    * Ventures must be able to outlive you
    * Or be shut down cleanly

42. **Founder Decay Strategy**

    * You reduce operational control over time
    * Navigator, not emperor

43. **Continuity & Succession Strategy**

    * Knowledge transfer
    * Institutional memory preservation

---

# **Final Count (Year 1 Kernel)**

**43 distinct strategies**, grouped, non-overlapping, already present in your system.

If you want, next I can:

* Turn this into a **formal Kernel Strategy Book document**
* Map each strategy → owning entity → squads
* Align each strategy to **Year-1 OKRs**
* Produce a **strategy dependency graph**
* Or reduce this to a **canonical “non-negotiables” spine**

Just say which direction you want to go next.

Perfect — those **are indeed missing kernel-level strategies**, and they belong **above** most operational layers. Below is the **cleanly integrated extension** to your **Year-1 Kernel Strategies Book**, not a bolt-on.

I am **not renumbering arbitrarily**; I’m inserting them where they structurally belong.

---

# **YEAR-1 KERNEL STRATEGIES BOOK — ADDENDUM**

*(Core Strategies + Archive Strategy)*

These strategies govern **identity, continuity, memory, and coherence** of the entire system — including you as a thinking entity.

---

## **0. CORE STRATEGIES (Pre-Meta Layer)**

> These exist *before* meta-strategy. They define what is non-negotiable.

### **0.1 Core Identity Strategy**

* Defines *who you are* across roles:

  * Navigator
  * Founder
  * Engineer
  * Steward
* Prevents role drift and self-contradiction
* Used to resolve internal conflicts before organizational ones

---

### **0.2 Core Intent Strategy**

* Why anything exists at all
* Distinguishes:

  * What must exist
  * What may exist
  * What must never exist
* Canonical source of “stop” decisions

---

### **0.3 Core Values & Constraint Strategy**

* Human viability
* Non-extraction
* Anti-capture
* Long-horizon responsibility
* These override:

  * Revenue
  * Speed
  * Prestige
  * Optional growth

---

### **0.4 Core Continuity Strategy**

* Ensures system meaning survives:

  * Fatigue
  * Delegation
  * Founder absence
* Separates:

  * What evolves
  * What persists
  * What must be preserved intact

---

### **0.5 Core Coherence Strategy**

* Ensures:

  * No internal contradictions
  * No parallel realities
  * No duplicated truths
* Governs doctrine arbitration and narrative alignment

---

## **I. META & SYSTEM STRATEGIES (Revised Placement)**

*(Your previously defined Meta-Strategy stack remains valid, but is now **anchored** by Core Strategies rather than floating.)*

Meta-Strategy now explicitly answers:

> “How do strategies serve core intent without violating core constraints?”

---

## **NEW MAJOR KERNEL SECTION**

# **ARCHIVE & KNOWLEDGE STRATEGIES**

This is not “documentation.”
This is **institutional memory engineering**.

---

## **XI. Archive, Memory & Knowledge System Strategies**

### **44. Archive Strategy (Master)**

**Purpose:**
To ensure *nothing essential is ever lost*, even as systems evolve.

Covers:

* Notes
* Documents
* Data
* Decisions
* Designs
* Failures
* Rationale
* Wisdom

Archive ≠ storage
Archive = **structured memory + meaning**

---

### **45. Archive Creation Strategy**

* What is worth capturing
* When capture is mandatory
* Who is responsible for capture
* What must never remain “implicit”

---

### **46. Archive Formation Strategy**

* How raw material becomes:

  * Artifacts
  * Records
  * Canon
* Converts chaos → structured knowledge

---

### **47. Archive Organization Strategy**

* Taxonomies
* Versioning
* Cross-linking
* Lineage tracking
* Dependency mapping

This prevents:

* Orphan knowledge
* Forgotten rationale
* False rediscovery

---

### **48. Archive Maintenance Strategy**

* Review cycles
* Rot detection
* Deprecation rules
* Archival audits

Nothing stays “alive” by default.

---

### **49. Archive Development Strategy**

* Turning records into:

  * Doctrine
  * Playbooks
  * Frameworks
* Knowledge maturation pathways

---

### **50. Archive Access & Retrieval Strategy**

* Who can see what
* When
* Under what conditions
* With what interpretive context

Prevents:

* Misuse
* Decontextualized application
* Weaponized partial truth

---

### **51. Archive Governance Strategy**

* Authority over:

  * Canon
  * Amendments
  * Redactions
  * Deletions
* Prevents silent history rewriting

---

### **52. Archive Continuity & Succession Strategy**

* Archive survives:

  * Role changes
  * Team turnover
  * Platform migrations
* Archive is portable, not tool-locked

---

### **53. Archive → Strategy Feedback Strategy**

* Archive informs:

  * Strategy updates
  * Risk detection
  * Pattern recognition
* Closed learning loop

---

## **UPDATED FINAL KERNEL COUNT**

| Layer                     | Strategy Count           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Core Strategies           | 5                        |
| Meta / System             | 5                        |
| NPO / Operations          | 9                        |
| Org / Entity / Coop       | 5                        |
| Capital / Finance         | 6                        |
| Legal / Risk / Compliance | 4                        |
| Programs / Cycles         | 6                        |
| GTM / Narrative           | 4                        |
| Technology / Platforms    | 3                        |
| Human / Culture           | 3                        |
| Archive / Knowledge       | 10                       |
| **TOTAL**                 | **53 Kernel Strategies** |

---

## **Why This Matters (Explicitly)**

Without these additions:

* Strategy collapses under memory loss
* Founder intent degrades over delegation
* Decisions lose rationale
* Knowledge repeats instead of compounds

With them:

* You gain **strategic immortality without centralization**
* The system learns even when people leave
* Archive becomes a **strategic asset**, not a liability

---

### If you want next, I can:

* Formalize this as a **print-ready Kernel Strategy Book**
* Map **archive objects → lifecycle → tools**
* Design your **Archive OS** (objects, states, flows)
* Define **what must be archived vs disposable**
* Build a **canonical archive taxonomy** aligned to OVCS + Msingi

Just tell me the next move.

Excellent — this is the **right sequencing**.
Below is a **single, integrated system design** that does all three things you asked for, coherently and operably:

1. **Maps archive objects → lifecycle → tools**
2. **Designs your Archive OS** (objects, states, flows, authorities)
3. **Defines a canonical archive taxonomy aligned to OVCS + Msingi**

This is written as a **kernel specification**, not notes.

---

# ARCHIVE OS — KERNEL SPECIFICATION

**Navigator Personal Office | OVCS | Msingi-aligned**

> The Archive is not storage.
> The Archive is the system’s memory, conscience, and continuity engine.

---

## I. ARCHIVE OBJECT MODEL (WHAT EXISTS)

Every archived thing is an **Object** with identity, lineage, authority, and lifecycle.

### **Canonical Archive Object Types**

#### **A. Thought Objects**

Raw cognition and sensemaking.

* Notes
* Journals
* Sketches
* Voice transcripts
* Whiteboard captures

**Purpose:** Capture pre-structured intelligence
**Risk if lost:** Repeated thinking, degraded originality

---

#### **B. Decision Objects**

Why something happened.

* Decision records
* Tradeoff analyses
* Rejected options
* Authority sign-offs
* Constraint rulings (OVCS)

**Purpose:** Preserve rationale
**Risk if lost:** History rewritten, poor future decisions

---

#### **C. Doctrine Objects**

Non-negotiable truths.

* Core principles
* Msingi doctrine
* Constraints
* Canonical definitions
* Invariants

**Purpose:** System coherence
**Risk if lost:** Drift, contradiction, capture

---

#### **D. Strategy Objects**

Intentional direction.

* Kernel strategies
* Sub-strategies
* Strategic roadmaps
* Sunset conditions

**Purpose:** Alignment & prioritization
**Risk if lost:** Tactical chaos

---

#### **E. Program Objects**

Structured execution.

* Msingi programs
* Ashe cycles
* Kano pipelines
* Zamba frames

**Purpose:** Repeatable delivery
**Risk if lost:** Reinvention, mis-sequencing

---

#### **F. Artifact Objects**

Concrete outputs.

* Documents
* Diagrams
* Code
* Models
* Media

**Purpose:** Evidence & reuse
**Risk if lost:** Lost work, compliance gaps

---

#### **G. Governance Objects**

Authority & oversight.

* Charters
* Bylaws
* Council rulings
* OVCS audits
* Compliance logs

**Purpose:** Legitimacy
**Risk if lost:** Invalid authority, legal exposure

---

#### **H. Narrative Objects**

Meaning and signal.

* Essays
* Position papers
* Public narratives
* Internal memos
* Cultural signals

**Purpose:** Sensemaking & legitimacy
**Risk if lost:** Fragmented identity

---

#### **I. Learning Objects**

System intelligence.

* Retrospectives
* Metrics
* Postmortems
* Pattern analyses

**Purpose:** Evolution
**Risk if lost:** Stagnation

---

## II. ARCHIVE LIFECYCLE MODEL (HOW OBJECTS EVOLVE)

Every object **must** be in exactly one lifecycle state.

### **Lifecycle States**

```
[Capture] → [Formed] → [Validated] → [Active] → [Canonical] → [Archived]
                       ↘ [Rejected]     ↘ [Deprecated]
```

---

### **State Definitions**

#### **1. Capture**

* Raw, unstructured
* No authority yet
* Immutable timestamp

Examples:

* Notes
* Brain dumps
* Meeting scribbles

---

#### **2. Formed**

* Structured
* Tagged
* Linked to origin

Examples:

* Draft docs
* Structured notes
* Early diagrams

---

#### **3. Validated**

* Reviewed
* Authority assigned
* Constraint-checked (OVCS if applicable)

Examples:

* Approved strategies
* Signed decisions
* Cleared frameworks

---

#### **4. Active**

* Currently governing or used
* Subject to versioning
* Referenced by execution systems

---

#### **5. Canonical**

* Highest authority
* Non-contradictable without formal override
* Minimal, stable, protected

Examples:

* Msingi doctrine
* Core constraints
* Kernel strategies

---

#### **6. Archived**

* No longer active
* Retained for lineage, audit, learning

---

#### **7. Deprecated**

* Still referenced historically
* Explicitly superseded
* Not valid for new use

---

#### **8. Rejected**

* Invalid
* Failed validation
* Retained only for learning

---

## III. ARCHIVE FLOWS (HOW OBJECTS MOVE)

### **Primary Flows**

#### **Capture → Formation Flow**

* Who: Individual contributors
* Trigger: Insight, decision, output
* Tooling: Fast, low-friction

---

#### **Formation → Validation Flow**

* Who: Stewards, councils, OVCS (as needed)
* Trigger: Claimed authority or reuse intent
* Tooling: Review + audit

---

#### **Validation → Canonization Flow**

* Who: Doctrine owners, OVCS
* Trigger: Non-negotiable system relevance
* Tooling: Locked repositories

---

#### **Active → Archive Flow**

* Who: Lifecycle owners
* Trigger: Sunset, replacement, inactivity
* Tooling: Cold storage + index

---

#### **Archive → Learning Feedback Flow**

* Who: Strategy, risk, program leads
* Trigger: Retrospective, failure, redesign
* Tooling: Analysis & synthesis tools

---

## IV. ARCHIVE OS (OPERATING SYSTEM DESIGN)

### **Core OS Components**

#### **1. Archive Registry (Index Layer)**

* Unique ID per object
* Type
* Lifecycle state
* Authority owner
* Lineage links

> This is the *source of truth*, not files.

---

#### **2. Object Stores (Storage Layer)**

| Store Type  | Purpose               |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Hot Store   | Active work           |
| Warm Store  | Referenced history    |
| Cold Store  | Legal / audit         |
| Canon Store | Doctrine & invariants |

---

#### **3. Authority Engine**

* Who can:

  * Create
  * Validate
  * Canonize
  * Deprecate
* OVCS hooks live here

---

#### **4. Lineage Engine**

* Tracks:

  * What came from what
  * What replaced what
  * What depends on what

This prevents:

* Orphan doctrine
* Silent drift

---

#### **5. Retrieval & Context Engine**

* Search is contextual, not keyword-only
* Always returns:

  * Status
  * Authority
  * Replacement (if deprecated)

---

## V. CANONICAL ARCHIVE TAXONOMY

**(Aligned to OVCS + Msingi)**

### **Top-Level Taxonomy**

```
/00_Core
/01_Doctrine
/02_Strategy
/03_Governance
/04_Programs
/05_Entities
/06_Operations
/07_Capital

## VI. TOOL MAPPING (WHAT TO USE WHERE)

### **Recommended Tool Roles (Not Prescriptive Brands)**

| Function  | Tool Class                 |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Capture   | Notes, voice, whiteboard   |
| Formation | Structured docs, diagrams  |
| Registry  | Database / graph           |
| Canon     | Versioned, locked repo     |
| Audit     | Immutable logs             |
| Retrieval | Search + graph view        |
| Learning  | Analysis & synthesis tools |

> Tools are **replaceable**.
> Taxonomy, lifecycle, and authority are **not**.

---

## VII. NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

1. **Nothing Canonical is Unversioned**
2. **Nothing Active Lacks Authority**
3. **Nothing Deprecated Is Silent**
4. **Nothing Important Lives Only in One Tool**
5. **Archive Objects Outlive Teams**

---

## VIII. WHAT THIS ENABLES

* Strategic memory without centralization
* Founder intent without founder dependence
* Auditability without bureaucracy
* Learning without repetition
* Authority without opacity

---

### If you want next, I can:

* Instantiate this as a **Notion / Obsidian / Git hybrid**
* Generate **Archive object schemas**
* Build **OVCS audit hooks into the Archive OS**
* Create **“what must be archived” enforcement rules**
* Produce a **visual architecture diagram**

Say the word and the next layer gets locked in.

Below is the **complete, single, continuous table** of **all strategies in your Strategy Book (Year-1 Kernel)**, including **core strategies, meta strategies, operational strategies, and the full archive/knowledge strategy stack**.

This table is **canonical**, **deduplicated**, and **layered correctly** (core → meta → execution → continuity).
No sections are omitted. No strategy appears twice under different names.

## **Canonical Total**

**63 strategies**
(All required for Year-1 system ignition, safety, coherence, execution, and continuity.)

### If you want next (recommended sequencing):

1. **Map each strategy → owning entity → squads**
2. **Bind strategies to OKRs & WBS**
3. **Lock which strategies are canonical vs evolvable**
4. **Generate a printable Strategy Book (PDF / Markdown / Notion)**

Say the word and I’ll move to the next lock-in step.

Below is the **single, long, continuous, canonical table** of your **FIRST 100 STRATEGIES for Year 1**, **including every strategy already generated** and **extending the book to a full 100 without duplication**.

This is written as a **kernel-grade strategy register**:

* Continuous numbering
* One strategy = one governing intent
* Correct layering (Core → Meta → Execution → Continuity)
* No filler, no marketing fluff, no rephrased duplicates

## ✅ **Status**

* **100 strategies**
* **Single continuous table**
* **Year-1 appropriate**
* **Kernel-grade**
* **No duplicates**
* **Fully aligned to OVCS + Msingi + Archive OS**

---

If you want next, I strongly recommend:

* **Locking which of these 100 are canonical vs provisional**
* Mapping **strategy → owning entity → squad**
* Generating a **Strategy Book v1.0 (print + digital)**

Just say the next command.

Below is the **canonical mapping of Strategy → Owning Entity → Primary Squad** for your **Year-1 Strategy Book (S-001 → S-100)**.

**Design rules used**

* **One owner** per strategy (clear accountability)
* **One primary squad** (execution lead). Secondary contributors implied but not listed to keep this usable.
* Entities align to your system: **NPO**, **OVCS**, **Msingi Council**, **Studios**, **Program Offices**, **Treasury**, **Legal**, **Platform**.

## How to use this immediately

1. **Create one squad charter per row** (owner, mandate, inputs/outputs).
2. **Bind budgets & OKRs** at the squad level.
3. **Set escalation paths**: Squad → Owning Entity → OVCS (if doctrine/risk).

If you want, next I can:

* Collapse this into a **Year-1 org chart**
* Generate **squad charters (1-page each)**
* Map **strategies → quarterly OKRs**
* Produce a **RACI overlay** (Owner / Steward / Consulted)

Say the next step and I’ll lock it in.

Below is a **canonical, Year-1 OKR map** that ties your **100 strategies → quarterly OKRs**.
Design intent: **Q1 = establish & survive**, **Q2 = operationalize**, **Q3 = compound**, **Q4 = harden & prepare Year-2**.

To keep this *usable*, strategies are **clustered into OKR themes per quarter** (this is how real systems run), while **every strategy is explicitly assigned** to a quarter as **Primary (P)** or **Secondary (S)**.

### If you want next (high-leverage):

* Convert this into **OKR scorecards per squad**
* Generate **Q1 OKRs only (weekly executable)**
* Build a **strategy → OKR → KPI graph**
* Produce a **board-ready Year-1 plan**

Say the next command and I’ll proceed.

Below is your **Year-1 Strategic Plan**, written as a **single, coherent operating plan** that integrates everything we’ve built:
core intent, OVCS, Msingi, Archive OS, the 100 strategies, ownership, and quarterly OKRs.

This is not a pitch deck.
This is the **plan you actually run**.

---

# **YEAR-1 STRATEGIC PLAN**

**Navigator Personal Office (NPO) · OVCS · Msingi-Aligned**

---

## **1. PURPOSE OF YEAR 1**

**Year 1 is not about growth.**
Year 1 is about **making existence irreversible**.

By the end of Year 1:

* The system **exists coherently**
* Authority is **clear and enforceable**
* Memory is **institutional, not personal**
* Revenue exists but does not dictate behavior
* Founder presence is **important but not required**
* Year 2 becomes a choice, not a necessity

---

## **2. STRATEGIC NORTH STAR**

> **Build a living system that can think, decide, remember, and act without collapsing into chaos, capture, or burnout.**

This governs all tradeoffs.

---

## **3. YEAR-1 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (IN ORDER)**

1. **Coherence before scale**
2. **Authority before execution**
3. **Memory before optimization**
4. **Capability before headcount**
5. **Optionality before growth**

Any action that violates this order is deferred or rejected.

---

* **Decision traceability enforced**
* **12-month runway protected**

### What You Explicitly Do NOT Do

* No scaling
* No speculative hiring
* No aggressive revenue tactics
* No premature automation

### End-of-Phase Definition of Success

---

## **5. OPERATING MODEL FOR THE YEAR**

### Authority

* **OVCS** governs doctrine, risk, ethics

* **Programs & Studios** execute within constraints
* **Archive** preserves truth and lineage

### Decision Discipline

* No decision without owner
* No owner without authority
* No authority without documentation
* No documentation without archiving

---

## **6. RESOURCE POSTURE**

### People

* Small, high-trust, capability-dense
* Stewards over operators
* Squads over individuals

### Capital

* Conservative
* Ring-fenced
* Runway-first

### Attention

* Your scarcest resource
* Protected via load-shedding and delegation
* No meeting, project, or idea without justification

---

## **7. RISKS YOU ARE INTENTIONALLY MANAGING**

* Founder bottleneck
* Memory loss
* Ethical drift
* Over-complexity
* Revenue capture
* Silent centralization

The plan is designed to **absorb these without heroics**.

---

## **8. YEAR-1 SUCCESS (CLEARLY DEFINED)**

Year 1 is successful if:

* You are **less essential to daily operations**
* The system **remembers better than you do**
* Authority is **clear and respected**
* Revenue exists **without distortion**
* Nothing important depends on improvisation

---

## **9. WHAT THIS PLAN MAKES POSSIBLE**

If executed faithfully, Year-1 enables:

* Year-2 scale **or** stability
* Founder exit **or** deeper involvement
* Federation **without fragmentation**
* Longevity **without stagnation**

---

### Recommended next steps (in order):

1. **Lock Q1 execution checklist**
2. Generate **Q1 weekly operating cadence**
3. Produce **Strategy Book v1.0 (print + digital)**
4. Stand up **Archive OS in tooling**
5. Draft **succession & continuity simulations**

If you want, say:

> “Generate my Q1 execution checklist”

…and we move from strategy to action.

* Quarterly phase logic (Q1–Q4)
* Explicit objectives, required actions, deliverables, and red flags
* Clear operating cadence
* Decision discipline
* Role-based checklists
* A concrete definition of Year-1 success

I will **not repeat the contents here** since you can see and work directly in the playbook.

> **How the system actually runs in Year 1 without collapsing.**

---

# **YEAR-1 OPERATIONAL PLAN**

**Navigator Personal Office (NPO) · OVCS · Msingi-Aligned**

---

## 1. OPERATIONAL INTENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Year 1 operations exist to:

* Keep the system **coherent**
* Keep the system **legal**
* Keep the system **funded**
* Keep the system **remembering**
* Keep the founder **non-fragile**

**Operations do not optimize.
Operations stabilize.**

## 2. OPERATING PRINCIPLES (ENFORCED DAILY)

1. **No owner → no work**
2. **No authority → no decision**
3. **No archive record → decision does not exist**
4. **No lifecycle → no continuation**
5. **No runway → stop**

If any principle is violated, operations pause until corrected.

---

## 3. YEAR-1 OPERATING STRUCTURE

### 3.1 Core Operating Bodies

**Navigator Personal Office (NPO)**
– Sequencing, prioritization, conflict resolution
– Owns operational cadence

**OVCS**
– Doctrine, ethics, risk, compliance, audit
– Veto authority over violations

**Program Offices (Msingi, Ashe, Kano, etc.)**
– Execute within constraints
– Cannot override doctrine or risk limits

**Archive Office**
– Memory, traceability, canon
– No execution authority, full visibility

---

3. Ethical drift check
4. Deprecations / sunsets

---

## 5. DAILY OPERATIONS (LIGHTWEIGHT)

Every day, every contributor must:

* Capture decisions made
* Capture risks observed
* Capture learning moments

No long reports.
No narrative padding.
Just traceable facts.

---

## 6. QUARTERLY OPERATIONAL FOCUS

### Q1 — EXISTENCE & SAFETY

Operational focus:

* Legal validity
* Financial runway
* Archive OS working
* Authority respected

Operational rule:

> If it does not help survival or coherence, it does not run.

---

### Q2 — EXECUTION WITHOUT FOUNDER LOAD

Operational focus:

* Squads running independently
* Studios time-boxed
* Revenue flowing but constrained

Operational rule:

> Founder does not execute; founder arbitrates.

---

### Q3 — LEARNING & HARDENING

Operational focus:

* Retrospectives
* Risk drills
* Ethical simulations
* Partner boundary enforcement

Operational rule:

> Failure is allowed; repetition is not.

---

### Q4 — CONTINUITY & READINESS

Operational focus:

* Succession drills
* Continuity simulations
* Archive audit
* Strategy sunset

Operational rule:

> The system must survive leadership absence.

---

## 7. OPERATIONAL CONTROLS (ALWAYS ON)

### 7.1 Cash Control

* Weekly cash check
* Monthly runway projection
* Immediate stop if < 9 months runway

### 7.2 Risk Control

* Single risk register
* Risks ranked weekly
* OVCS can halt operations unilaterally

### 7.3 Founder Load Control

* Founder time tracked weekly
* If execution > 30%, delegation enforced

### 7.4 Archive Control

* No undocumented decisions
* No undocumented authority
* Canon protected from casual edits

---

## 8. OPERATIONAL FAILURE MODES (WATCH FOR THESE)

If you see any of the following, operations are failing:

* Founder making daily execution decisions
* Teams asking “who decides?” repeatedly
* Decisions not traceable after one week
* Revenue dictating strategy
* Studios becoming permanent
* Ethics handled informally

When detected: **stop, diagnose, correct**.

---

## 9. OPERATIONAL SUCCESS CONDITIONS (CLEAR & MEASURABLE)

Year-1 operations are successful if:

* You can step away for 30–60 days
* Decisions remain consistent
* Risks are visible before they explode
* Knowledge compounds instead of evaporates
* Growth remains optional

---

## 10. WHAT THIS OPERATIONAL PLAN DELIBERATELY AVOIDS

* Complex tooling
* Excess meetings
* Vanity metrics
* Hero culture
* Unbounded growth
* Informal authority

---

## 11. FINAL OPERATING DIRECTIVE

> **If the system cannot explain what it is doing, why it is doing it, who owns it, and where it is recorded — it stops.**

That is how you survive Year 1 **without losing the system, the mission, or yourself**.

---

If you want next, the correct follow-ons are:

* **Q1 daily/weekly checklist**
* **Founder load-shedding rules**
* **Operational dashboards (what to watch, not tools)**
* **Crisis response runbook**

Say which one to generate.
