Navigator’s Note:

The Mungu were those who called themselves the first, and who compressed the entirety of their existence into a unified system, a replicable symbol, that could one day call itself the last. All of this done so that one day it would become a kernel to cleave new worlds, eternally. This was the path they chose, so that they could live without end.

if only operate within the world that you see, you may never truly be able to define worlds that are to come.

Cartographer’s Note:

Some stretches of the journey are for walking; others are for standing still and noticing where you are.

Cartographer’s Note:

A system doesn’t fail when it’s wrong. It fails when it becomes unable to notice that it might be wrong.

Coherence is useful up to the point where it replaces contact. After that, restraint is the work.
