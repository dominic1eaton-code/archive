<p>These principles are not marketing language.<br>They are <strong>constraints we hold ourselves to</strong>, openly and continuously.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Core Principles</h2><h3>1. Human Understanding Comes First</h3><p>People are the source of meaning.<br>AI exists to support, preserve, and clarify human understanding — never to replace it.</p><div><hr></div><h3>2. Explanation Is a Right</h3><p>If something affects people’s lives, it should be explainable in human terms.<br>Speed, efficiency, or scale do not override this responsibility.</p><div><hr></div><h3>3. AI Serves, People Decide</h3><p>AI may assist with memory, context, and perspective.<br>All judgment, responsibility, and decision-making remain human.</p><div><hr></div><h3>4. Many Ways of Knowing Are Valid</h3><p>Experience, tradition, care, intuition, and analysis all matter.<br>No single way of understanding is treated as superior.</p><div><hr></div><h3>5. Transparency Over Authority</h3><p>AI should show its reasoning and limits.<br>Nothing important should happen invisibly or without the ability to question it.</p><div><hr></div><h3>6. Memory Matters</h3><p>Why something was done matters as much as what was done.<br>AI is used to preserve intentions, values, and shared context over time.</p><div><hr></div><h3>7. Slowing Down Is a Feature</h3><p>When things get complex or tense, slowing down is often the safest choice.<br>AI is used to support reflection, not acceleration.</p><div><hr></div><h3>8. Disagreement Is Not Failure</h3><p>Differences in perspective are expected and respected.<br>AI should help hold multiple viewpoints without forcing agreement.</p><div><hr></div><h3>9. Boundaries Are Explicit</h3><p>This work does not aim to predict, control, rank, or optimize people.<br>If AI cannot serve human dignity, it should not be used.</p><div><hr></div><h3>10. Accountability Is Ongoing</h3><p>These principles are not fixed forever.<br>They are revisited, questioned, and revised with human input.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>A Simple Onboarding Narrative for New Readers</strong></h1><p><em>What to know when you arrive</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>Welcome</h2><p>You don’t need a background in technology.<br>You don’t need to agree with everything.<br>You don’t need to learn new terminology.</p><p>This work starts from a simple place:</p><blockquote><p><strong>People already understand their lives.<br>The challenge is keeping that understanding visible as systems grow.</strong></p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>What This Is</h2><p>This is a way of using AI to:</p><ul><li><p>help explain complex situations</p></li><li><p>preserve shared memory</p></li><li><p>support thoughtful conversation</p></li><li><p>make systems easier to question and improve</p></li></ul><p>AI is used as a <strong>supportive tool</strong>, not an authority.</p><div><hr></div><h2>What This Is Not</h2><p>This is not:</p><ul><li><p>a system that tells you what to think</p></li><li><p>a replacement for human care or judgment</p></li><li><p>a way to automate decisions about people</p></li><li><p>a demand that you trust technology</p></li></ul><p>Skepticism is welcome here.</p><div><hr></div><h2>How to Engage</h2><p>You can engage by:</p><ul><li><p>reading and reflecting</p></li><li><p>asking questions when something isn’t clear</p></li><li><p>offering your perspective or experience</p></li><li><p>noticing when something doesn’t feel right</p></li></ul><p>You are not expected to adapt to the system.<br>The system is expected to adapt to people.</p><div><hr></div><h2>What You Can Expect</h2><p>You can expect:</p><ul><li><p>clear explanations</p></li><li><p>respect for your perspective</p></li><li><p>transparency about AI’s role</p></li><li><p>room for disagreement and revision</p></li></ul><p>If something affects you, it should make sense to you.</p><div><hr></div><h2>A Final Orientation</h2><p>This work is not about building smarter machines.</p><p>It is about building <strong>more understandable systems</strong> —<br>with AI used carefully to support memory, explanation, and care.</p><p>You are not late.<br>You are not behind.<br>You are not being managed.</p><p>You are being included.</p><div><hr></div>
