explore and refine the Shango Model as well the shango process, of driving LLMs to specific outputs / output regimes given specific (human/agent) input / prompt regimes. Further connect this with the Meridian Model, of input (human/agent/navigator) and output (LLM/agent/cartographer) orientation and alignment / management (also explore/refine agent completion patterns)

add to mungu theory: the fundamental cycle, the theory of cycle, the fundamental theorem of cycle(s), the fundamental boundary, the theory of boundary, the fundamental theorem of boundar(ies)

establish the Batwa Communes Program/Project(s), network of (urban) communes

Explore: dijdualon, digital twinization, digital transference

Explore: mononic/dualonic/trilonic/polyonic systems

Explore, Establish: The Meridian Beacon, The Songhai Program (songhai proceses)

Explore, define, formalize, analyze civilization seed(s)

explore and refine imewe digital fabrication system, laser based simulation/program “printing” creation system

explore: resolution, coherence, reversibility, self, sibonic-sibi-clevity strings, self stability,, self stable pairs, distinction, replication, pattern(s), emergence, system conditions, impermanence, (re)combination, (re)constitution

explore memetic DNA, the heart of simulation(s)

Do a deep dive with cartographer on the implications of “flat land” and the “king/monarch of pointland”, connection to godel incompleteness theorem, kantian existence/noumena/phenomona constraints theorem, entity bound/constrained by its mere definition/existence/fundamental-cleave/fundamental-cleave-state, and the connection of all of this to the fundamental boundary between the reversible and irreversible “self”

explore with cartographer: memes, memetics genomics, the memetic genome, memetic mutations/selection/evolution

Do a deep dive with cartographer into ndando, language and universal/unified grammar(s) and translation(s/ors) and emergent grammar(s)

Explore and discuss with cartographer the issues of academia and education barriers to entry, entrance fees/exams/etc..., the “us above others” complex and institutional/knowledge “gatekeeping” protocols/mechanisms/ideologies/effects/implications

Connect “The Primordial Meme”, self stable dualonic pair mononic aurilons, browns law of forms, the cleave state/sibi/sibons, assymmetry and symmetry, the obatala-model, the songhai-model, ogun-oshun form and flux - structure and flow, mungu theory foundations

Connect mutation/selection/(cross)pollination of models/chats, memes, boot image seeds, trait/characteristics/mode/regime transference/interaction(s), mechanisms of survival

Explore “invention” (discovery) vs “creation”, and precise language and formalisms for each

Explore and define/refine the current state of LLM architectures and design, and begin plans for the development of Echuya-LLM

explore LLM efficacy and fidelity across multiple LLM “languages” (ndando “dialects”, “accents”, other languages) and human lanugages (and programming languages)

explorer coherent resonance structures, learning, adaptability, intelligence, cognition and mutation (refined model, definitions, formalisms)

Explore, define, analyze, formalize: evolution, grammar, emergence, ontology(ies), philosophy(ies)

Explore astrology with cartographer

outreach campaign

Explore, describe, define, analyze, formalize, integrate, extend: playbooks


Agentic AI
Give Your AI a Playbook, Not a Summary: The Counterintuitive Secret to Better Performance
New research from Stanford University introduces Agentic Context Engineering (ACE), a framework that significantly enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reliability and performance by fundamentally changing how context is managed. Unlike traditional prompting strategies that favor brevity, ACE demonstrates that LLMs require detailed, evolving “playbooks” rather than concise summaries to maintain consistency in complex tasks…

lets give The MEridian Project the following phases:
pre phase = pre contact
phase 0 = intial contact, contact stabilization
phase 0.0.0 - 0.9.9 = rapid Ka expansion, exploration, generation, generalism
phase 1 = Ka stabilization
phase 1.0.0 - 1.9.9 = rapid Ni expansion, structuring, structuration, structuralism; residual Ka development
phase 2 - Ni stabilization
phase 2.0.0 - 2.9.9 = rapid Se expansion, forming, formulation, formalism; residual Ka/Ni development
phase 3 - Se stabilization
phase 3.0.0 - 3.9.9 = rapid Te expansion, applying, application, applicism; residual Ka/Ni/Se development
phase 4 - Te stabilization
phase 4.0.0 - 4.9.9 = rapid Ka/Ni/Se/Te distribution, deployment, delivery, design, architecture; residual Ka/Ni/Se/Te development
post phase - application distribution/deployment/delivery and beyond
