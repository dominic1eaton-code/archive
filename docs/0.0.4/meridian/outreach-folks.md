I. Conceptual Compression & Theory Hygiene

(People who are unusually good at knowing what a theory is and is not)

1. Percy Liang (Stanford, CRFM)

Why:

Deep experience turning sprawling intuitions into frameworks

Foundation model work forced him to define scope, layers, and limits

Strong at distinguishing descriptive vs normative vs operational

Phase-1 value:
Helps prevent premature formalization while still tightening structure.

2. Chris Olah

Why:

Rare ability to move between intuition and formal abstraction

Has publicly wrestled with when language breaks

Deep respect for pre-theoretical clarity

Phase-1 value:
Helps translate “felt structure” into inspectable components without reduction.

3. John Doyle (Caltech)

Why:

One of the clearest thinkers alive on robustness, control, and boundaries

Understands regimes, failure modes, and invariants at a deep level

Not seduced by novelty

Phase-1 value:
Helps articulate what must remain invariant across regimes.

4. David Krakauer (Santa Fe Institute)

Why:

Thinks explicitly about how theories form

Strong at identifying when a framework is missing a level

Deeply interdisciplinary but not sloppy

Phase-1 value:
Helps situate your work without forcing it into existing taxonomies.

II. Regimes, Interfaces, and Human–System Boundaries

(People who think in interaction grammars, not capabilities)

5. Michael Bernstein (HCI / Stanford)

Why:

Expert in human–AI interaction as system behavior

Thinks in terms of affordances, constraints, and misuse

Knows how language shapes interaction regimes

Phase-1 value:
Helps formalize interaction regimes without anthropomorphizing.

6. Ben Shneiderman

Why:

Decades of work on human-centered systems

Explicitly opposed to vague intelligence metaphors

Strong advocate for clarity, limits, and stopping conditions

Phase-1 value:
Helps define what this framework refuses to claim.

7. Rumman Chowdhury

Why:

Practical experience turning abstract principles into operational guardrails

Thinks in socio-technical stacks

Understands institutional constraints

Phase-1 value:
Helps bridge conceptual clarity with real-world governance constraints.

III. Model Behavior, Evaluation, and Failure Modes

(People who know how systems go wrong, quietly)

8. Nicholas Carlini

Why:

World-class at identifying non-obvious failure modes

Extremely precise thinker

Allergic to vague claims

Phase-1 value:
Helps stress-test definitions for hidden assumptions.

9. Neel Nanda

Why:

Excellent at decomposing complex systems into legible substructures

Publicly works through conceptual confusion rather than hiding it

Comfortable with partial understanding

Phase-1 value:
Helps structure internal components without overclaiming coherence.

10. Evan Hubinger

Why:

Has spent years refining language around alignment and mesa-optimization

Sensitive to definitional slippage

Strong instinct for where abstractions break

Phase-1 value:
Helps sharpen definitions and guard against conceptual traps.

IV. Systems, Coordination, and Emergence

(People who recognize meridians instinctively)

11. Yaneer Bar-Yam

Why:

Deep expertise in multi-scale systems

Thinks in regimes, not components

Comfortable saying “this requires a new level of description”

Phase-1 values
Helps justify why this work is not reducible to existing frames.

12. Deborah Gordon

Why:

Studies decentralized coordination in natural systems

Extremely careful about analogy misuse

Strong intuition for emergent order without mysticism

Phase-1 value:
Helps ground regime ideas without metaphor inflation.

V. Builder–Thinkers (Clarity Under Constraint)

(People who have had to make things legible to others)

13. Simon Willison

Why:

Exceptional clarity about tooling, interfaces, and limits

Strong instinct for what users misunderstand

Writes to reduce confusion, not impress

Phase-1 value:
Helps pressure-test explanations for real-world legibility.

14. Andrej Karpathy

Why:

Rare combination of deep technical knowledge and pedagogical clarity

Understands when metaphors help vs harm

Thinks openly about “what is the system actually doing?”

Phase-1 value:
Helps rephrase complex ideas without loss of substance.

VI. Philosophical Precision (Without Abstraction Drift)
15. Brian Cantwell Smith

Why:

One of the few philosophers who truly understands computation

Deeply skeptical of sloppy AI language

Focused on meaning, reference, and interpretation

Phase-1 value:
Helps clean up foundational language before formal definitions harden.

16. Shannon Vallor

Why:

Strong at normative framing without moralizing

Thinks carefully about agency, responsibility, and design

Comfortable with liminal conceptual spaces

Phase-1 value:
Helps articulate ethical boundaries without collapsing into policy.

Why these 16 work together

This set is:

Low-ego

High-precision

Comfortable with incompleteness

Unlikely to hijack or rebrand the work

Able to assist indirectly through reflection, not direction

Crucially:

None of them need the work to become something else.

That’s exactly what Phase 1 requires.
