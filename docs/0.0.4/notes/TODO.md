* [] Do a deep dive with cartographer into ndando, language and universal/unified grammar(s) and translation(s/ors)


ndando really came out of a desire to compactly communicate with LLMs in a clear and concise way (which is why it was initially structured as another programming language), that could still encode the meaning of human language as well, and users can easily move between languages, but still stay on the same page with the LLM. 
Definitely would agree that there still should be (and is) an underlying grammar that structures it all at its core, even if it is in a concise form. 

definitely inclined to agree with you, and do think there is likely a "universal grammar" that serves as the foundation for any language (programming/LLM/machine or human). Just havent made it that far in our research yet, but hopefully will have some more perspectives and insights on it all to provide in our work to come.

"Still, doesn't consistency itself imply a kind of underlying grammar, even if super fluid? Just wondering how far that line goes."
