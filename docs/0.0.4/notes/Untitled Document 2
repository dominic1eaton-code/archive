AgentSim-A current project for studying and developing complex autonomous systems. This in-development project (which can be viewed from the Github Link) is a "system of systems" (or a "systems tool-chain") which is hoped to facilitate, with ease, the development of complex autonomous systems from several perspectives.

3 favorite papers 
"The Part-Time Parliament" by Leslie Lamport; "On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances" by Josiah Gibbs; "A new kind of Science" by Stephen Wolfram; These papers, from a personal perspective, seem to exemplify an ideal scientific model that requires the combination of descriptive intuition, as well as prescriptive comprehensiveness and [concise] clarity in formal presentation of solutions. These papers have the possibility to reflect a continuous "story in the making" that may perhaps lead into the development of complex system technologies that shall have many benefits to various aspects of everyday life. Starting from the most basic laws of energy and entropy which governs our physical reality, and slowly forming these into a theory of system complexity that can be used for many different applications leads one to have great fondness for what these papers represent (or what they may have the potential to represent, at least).

"Flatland" by Edwin Abbot Abbot; "1984" by George Orwell; "Paradise Lost" by John Milton. In reality, the idea that any of these books (or any other work) can be viewed as a favorite is a difficult one to accept. There are many works that I enjoy, where each of which delineate subtle and interesting points about the nature of the reality of existence, and my "liking" or "dis-liking" of any of these works is changing with time. Currently, do the three works presented have appeal as they appear to show the effects of curiosity and hubris (superficially looking at these works) can lead to an eventuality of "stable perdition", and what this idea could mean in relation to the development of current technologies (such as that of self-driving cars for example) is still not clear, yet worth due consideration nonetheless.
