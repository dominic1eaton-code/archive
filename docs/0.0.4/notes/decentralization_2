and so what examples of a "blockchain" ledger do we have in the world. In my mind does "recorded history" come forth. As it is said "history is written by the victors" which could suggest that there are many histories that could have persistied at one time, but did the "victors" decide what the final recording shall be, and what should be rememebered by all of those to come. Interesestingly, might this record also be considered "living" as in scholars from times after are in constant contemplation and seek verification, long after the final manuscripts have been completed. There are times when history is corrected or mended, as it is hoped that the hsitory that actually occured, is the one that is recorded or remebered, but that is not always the case. From this do I believe that the "static-ness" that exists with the immutability distibuted ledger may not be the final solution, and furthermore is there a part of me that believes that is not even what is recorded that is of real value. It is of what the poeple believe, and more importantly, what the people can agree on (as to form a [solid] foundation from which to build upon) which is the real utility in this artifact. Beliefs change however, and new understandings "of the universe" may cause history to be interpreted in a different light as time progresses. It seems that intepretebility, along with commonality of understanding, and access to information, begin to form the pillars for which a technology for the purposes of achieving "decentralization" may be built. At least that is what I believe from what I have seen now. 

As always, do I say that this is a "living" idea, and of course is subject to change as it is revisted and re-thought in the days ahead.
