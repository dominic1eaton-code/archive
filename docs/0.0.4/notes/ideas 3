	Humans have such formal logic and rules that we use to evaulate and reason about the validity and veracity of the things presented to us. So perhaps it may very well be the case the smart contracts may also need to be endowed with the capabilities of reasoning, prediction, and semantic validation of their programs, not merely just syntactical validation. This is, of course, a step above of what most programming languages do to date, as many just check simply for syntactical consistency and not for semantic validity, but for instance Ethereum's solidity will perhaps need to do more than that in the future in order to achieve true feasibility and usability moving forward. Semantics may be a difficult thing for the smart contract to ignore, as even in human contracts, carefully worded contracts that convey very particular semantics can spell the difference between desirable behavior for one party, and a tragic situation for another. Semantics have such a great impact on the functionality of a contract, that is rather difficult for me to imagine a smart contract programming language would not contain at the very least some rudimentary mecanism for semantic validation, on some level. 
	one may immediately think "on just throw machine learning at it" or "okay, lets just use some statistical inferencing model". This may attempt to mitigate the inherent static nature of smart contracts, and contracts in general, as when contracts are first created, they are by their nature, not meant to be changed, to be rules and laws followed, external to the involved parties, for which groups can follow with trust that need not be in each other.
	Naturaly the question becomes, how to achieve such semantic validation ? How to incorporate reasoning and formal logic verification mechanisms ? Can one even "throw machine learning" at the problem ? and what of predicion and anticipation of future unknown events, how does a smart contract handle these things ? Dealing with every possible edge case is clearly intractable, so one may attempt and find a system to where contracts seem to work pretty well and can, in general, deal with most edge cases without the entirety of the system collapsing. May it not be necessary to prevent the possibility of every edge case from occuring, but simply to try and ensure that the smart contract provides consistent, desired, and intended behavior. Of course, clarity needs to be ensured on what exactly "intended" behavior is, but
