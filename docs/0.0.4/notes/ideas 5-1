well why is it that one would desire to have trust placed in a set of rules than in a central authority ? why is that so much investment is going into is being poured into these technologies, when their centralized counterparts function signicantly faster, more securely, and "better" overall ? In rules and mathematics we trust, but what advantage does this have versus the systems that are implemented today ? With all of failings and shortcomings associated with blockchain technologies, it has been argued that any solution essentially boils down to proposing some centralization based method, defeating the purpose of having a decentralized system in the first place. So then, even if there are deficits in the centralized system, why not just strive to improve the currently, already working systems, or redesign them to better meet the desires the decentralization hopes to achieve, why introduce a new paradigm in the first place ?
