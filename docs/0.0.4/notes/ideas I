in a multi agent system, where each agent has a local model and learning capability, all of the agents are interacting and the possibility of learning from one another is possible. In the beginning, simply agents can learn by collecting information from toher agents through interation and apply distillation, averiging, mean field techniques to produce a general model based on the collective experience. From this general globalized model that the local agent devises, can it use this to do self improvement (learning, better regulation techniques, better prediction, etc...). Perhaps, this can be extended in that agents an do more than just find some average model from the collective. These continuous agent interactions could provide the means for an evolutationary optimization paradigm to exist among them. This idea of course, is transfer learning, and somewhat more specifically, multi task/agent learning, but that is just to say that another (perhaps better?) technique, other than (just) simple averaging, may exist for allowing agents to "get the most" from the information they obtain to create better ideas of globalized agent state.
