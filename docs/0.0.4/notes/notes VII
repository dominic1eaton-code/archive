- the rise of science
- reconstructing / generating information without the need for a "full picture"
- (westernized) reductionism - linearity / additivity / superposition; "degeneration into parts" → understanding of "complex systems"; constituent part analysis; LTI systems; standardization; curriculum learning
- knowing start state implies full characterization of future system trajectory / development
- extrapolation / generalization (generalizability) → composability; logic, reason; symmetry
- the rise of blueprints (standards, final / mature state representation (rigid growth, development models))
- variability (disorder) - minimization of variability through increasing complexity (reductive-ness)
- noise -> "discrepancy from what truly is going on"
- depth implying understanding, and composition implying "working solutions" (the "breadth" perspective ? depth-breadth hybrid models ?)
- Hubel and Weisel (step-wise brain perception extraction, manifold learning, "grandmother neurons", sparse coding of these neurons)
- inefficiencies of point-point reductive approaches
- bifurcating system, scale free
- coding / rules for bifurcation using reductionism impossibility
- stochastics, tranposons (gene transpositions)
- Ivan Chase -> fish dominance behavior emergence study, dyadic dominance pairing output (non predictability of system state evolution), 
- "not enough pieces to explain functions"; non-accountance of chance
- Non reductive systems - non linear / non additivity systems
- Chaoticism
- deterministic / periodicity / reductive (patterns, generalizability [in a different context], logical abstractions, symmetry (invariance [non-stochastic])) -> long term explainability / stability (steady state)
- "singularity points" [transition points] (shifting from reductionism to chaoticism), [Yorke - period 3], (relation to entropy based control mechanisms ?), perturbation / noise / variability (Lyapunov Exponent)
- [Strange] Attractors (points of stability / predictability) -> linear, equilibrating systems 
- "No correct answer as to what [one is] supposes to be observing", phenomena, consequence of the system, (relation to relativity ? QFT, QED, QCD, etc…)
- Measurement / observer bias
- amplification of minute differences (butterfly effect) (local effects -> global consequences)
- "the nature of variability [is scale free]" (fractals)
- fractal genes (molecular self-assembly ?)
- scale-based system studies 
- coefficient of variation
- noise, inherent characteristic of the system; variability is the system
- chaotic fractal systems
- reductionism (imprecision investigations [coarse grained studies] (Newtonian mechanics-special relativity relation))
- cellular automata
Questions
1. LTI systems and complex systems relations ? correspondence principles / relations between LTI and complex systems ?
2. Trust, capability, explanatory science, reductionism relation (trust based on / influenced capability, characterized / solidified by explanatory science, and achievable through reductionism ? dis-proof of this idea ? faults in this reasoning ?) ?
3. The scale free principle ? fractal theory ?
4. Reductionism as to imply that removing a part of system eliminates the "pre-baked" functionality of the excised part, and a "linear degeneration" is an absolute for a system (that can be linearly decomposed) (Karl Lashley - engrams). How does this idea relate to the concept of decentralization (and scale free / bifurcations / reliability theory / game theory (dominance hierarchy)), as well as state machine replication, system complexity / resilience, and the idea that removing a part of a system does not mean loss of that parts functionality, but another part of the system shall "fill in the gaps" of the excised / lost part ?
5. Classical - Quantum relation, Reductionism - Chaos relation ? → Newtonian - Special Relativity (correspondence principles) relation, Reductionism - Chaos relation ?
6. [Strange] Attractors, chaotics / linear systems, controllability, entropy (based control mechanisms) relation ?
7. Biology Design Philosophy - molecular self-assembly principles ?



Sopolsky lecture notes 22. Emergence and Complexity:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_ZuWbX-CyE
- convergence (inability to know starting state / conditions) (conservation of information… ?)
- starting state, mature state disconnection
- asymmetric states generally produce more variability than symmetric ones (asymmetry principle)
- a priori rule generation impossibility (in chaotic, non deterministic/reductionist systems) 
- circular (related / relative) learning / understanding
- multi-model neuron responses
- Karl Lashley - engrams (and explanability of brain functionality)
- fractal genes - "instructions are scale-free"
- the "space problem" / "the packing problem"
- fractal gene mutation
- Paul Green - organic system -> double saddle shape in response to heat ("emergent property of physical constraints of system")
- Francis Galton - wisdom of the crowds, prediction markets (Augur blockchain…) (unbiased / pre-exposed / limited observability crowd members [agents])
- emergent complexity 
- simple agents / simple nearest neighbor rules
- "bottom up organization (rather than top down)" [?]
- evolutionary algorithms / optimization (GA, Swarm intelligence, Ant Colonization, Bee Optimization, Grey Wolf, Glow worm, Fire Work, simulated annealing, etc…) also, Multi-Objetive optimzation ([multi objective] GA, EA, SPEA, SPEA2, MOEA, MOEA2, etc…) (Convex vs Non Convex / non-linear vs Multi Objective optimzation characterizations and relations to comlpex systems ?) (Meta-Learning ? Hierarchical Reinforcment Learning connection ? - Google neural network architecture optimzied by GA connection… https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/using-evolutionary-automl-to-discover.html) (privacy in machine learning / privacy presreving predictions connection … ?) (Formal machine learning methods [Statistical Learning Thoery, PAC Learning, VC learning, etc…] connection… ?) (Distributed Learning, Federated Learning, Distributed Systems (also, Blockchain [decentralization] concepts) connection… ?) ?
- the "bee dance"
- attraction-repulsion models [?] (Artificial potential fields ?) (vehicle platooning [flocking, crowding, grouping] control methodologies [and Behavioral Based Controllers]) (optimal control and complex [autonomous] systems connection… ?) (Field theory, Feynman diagrams… ?)
- adaptive signals -> longer lasting connections, randomness / stochasticity 
- example: urban planning based on attraction-repulsion rules [models] (the complex autonomous city…) (internal state data collection methods [studying internally collected data for obtaining simple / general rules; using simple / general rules to "grow" [optimal] solutions])
- perturbations / spatial (space-time) distributions, power law distributions
- "solid, stable interactions among clusters of nodes, but occasionally has the capacity to make long distance connections" (Kademlia DHT parallel… ?)
- power law distribution changes / mutations …
- bottom up quality control systems (and self [organized, dative] correction), grassroots (no blueprints) (decentralization, wisdom of crowds, emergent properties / principles, governance [also economics, finance, law, contracts (theory)]) (topological data analysis [tda])
Sopolsky conclusions:
- "with enough quantity [one] invents quality"
- "emphasis on quantity"
- "simpler the constituent parts, the better" [?]
- "more, random interactions make for better more adaptive networks"
- "power of gradience of [attraction-repulsion] information" ("things that guide you toward/away from things", "nearst neighbor intreraction")
- "generalists work better in this these systems [emergent, adaptive] than specialists do" 
- emergent systems [thinking]
- "do not need blueprints, and do not need someone to make the blueprints"
