structuration 
labelling theories 

set II
augmentavist mindset - (vs recreationist mindset) e.g. creating simulation environments that augment / optimize a world / reality rather than just recreate a reality that already exists 

the isolationist mindset - meaning is constrained (and meaning is achievable through systematic constrain; only few [things] have [true/valid] meaning  

tensor representations
- distribution networks [tensors]
- representations 
- tensor networks
- *layered tensor representations - perhaps a common tensor network / object that has many different representations (that can be transformed from/to or altered) (the comlpex system "thickness" (a discretization property, where complex systems at varying scales can have many different "layers" (types of representations), at each discrete scaled)
- tensor structures abide by set of laws/principles (guided by physical world -> providing their meaning/utility) 

tensor data structures (representations)
- topology [tensor networks]
- biomass (environments, plants, animals, ecological)
- roads, infrasstructure 
- communication networks
- interaction networks 

On neural networks
- [tensorial] function approximators 
- non-linear compositions [function] fp = D * x -> (*) non-linear composition operator
- fp is (or could be) piece-wise (containing many nodes, each possessing a simple, linear [reduced] functionality) tensor representation transformation (tensor representation reduction in the NN case) function approximator, with many degrees of freedom ("neurons"/nodes) tuned by parameter weights beta... (the AI functionalities... the [(tensor) representation] reduction functionality...)
- linear, piece-wise, high degree of freedom may produce complex, non-linear behavior...
- general class of [tensor] representation compositions / tranforms (operators/functions)

blockchain 
- [objective] functions / operators ... ?
- state transition function[ality]
- many nodes performing local interactions (transferring resources [currency] between one another) ... the rise of non-linear, complex behaviors ?
- the [decentralized] consensus (consistency, equilibrious stability) function[ality]
- autonomy and centralization/decentralization... ? (and heirarchy)
- "the Bitcoin backbone protocol" / "the part-time parliament" / general blockchain theoretic [complex system, tensorial] extensions / representations...
- the "resource problem" (constrained / limited amount of resources [to complete some objective, task, etc… ??])

principles 
consistency principle - consensus / agreement / continuum,-a of the "matter' forming a complex system, where agents are able to "work together as a whole" to form a larger complex, organized system -> toward fractal (and  distillation+simplification) principle 
distilation principle - reduction down into formable "puzzle pieces" or forming bases for comparison / formulation / "complexation" -> toward forming consistency
compactness / simplification principle - continuous building of complexity into a "complicated simplicity" [state] -> toward forming consistency
compatibility principle - incentive [incentivized] compatibility, entropy based incentive / incentive compatibilities... (host-guest chemistry principles... ?)
fractal principle - scaled complexity / complexation / order

complicated (plicare, "folded" or highly compacted... compactness/simplification principle) simplicity vs trivial simplicity ...

- complexity diffusion (and differential equations…)
- complexity "thickness" (multi-layeredness)
- compounding tensor interactions / transforms (and change of bases (and change of representations / change of "perspective" of representation …))
- tensor structures invariance - Lagrangian/dynamics/morphological/etc… preservations… [especially with change of bases/representations…]
 -  perfection as dependent on space-time (extrema of space and time to reach any state to be conceived as "perfection" - all/any sub-states are "imperfections";perfectus-true completeness)
