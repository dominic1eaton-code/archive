regardless of initial conditions, or the systems sensitivity to intiial conditions, may perhaps a system of increasing dynamical complexity (2nd law of thermodynamics) at the low lever, will approach some regular structure at the high level. This regular structure(s) being basins of attraction and the modelling paradigm being chaos theory. Properties and proof about consistency of this phenomenon (along with statistical mechanics and the conservation of information) may subsequently arise from this idea. 
	The ability to abstract information about agent interactions at the high level and begin to make valid predictions (due to regularity and statbility brought on from attractors), regardless of the increasing complexity of low level, localized behavior, seems to be of high utility possibly.
