## software factory notes
Software factory features include
automated development and delivery pipelines using a "everything as code" approach, a "gold" baseline to ensure consistency, and a package of pre-built, reusable components and playbooks for tasks like security and monitoring. A software factory centralizes and standardizes tools, processes, and practices like DevOps and agile development, which enables faster, more consistent, and secure software delivery across multiple environments.

    Automated Development and Delivery: Uses pipelines to automate the creation and delivery of software, following "everything as code" principles (IaC, Pipeline as Code).

    Standardized "Gold" Baseline: Provides a consistent, pre-configured starting point for all projects to reduce variation and ensure a high-quality foundation.
    Pre-built Components and Playbooks: Offers reusable code libraries, templates, and playbooks for common functions like security, logging, and data integration to accelerate development.

    DevSecOps Automation: Integrates security into the development pipeline from the start, with automated vulnerability scanning and policy checks.

    Multi-environment Support: Engineered to work across different environments, including on-premises, cloud, and tactical edge systems.

    AI-Enabled Productivity: Can incorporate AI to assist with tasks like onboarding, hyper-automation, and manual processes. 

Benefits

    Increased Efficiency and Speed: Automation and standardization streamline development, leading to faster delivery times.

    Improved Quality and Consistency: Automated testing and standardized processes result in higher and more consistent code quality.

    Enhanced Security and Compliance: Security measures are built into the automated pipeline, helping to find and fix issues early and enforce compliance automatically.

    Reduced Waste and Redundancy: Eliminates the need for different teams to repeatedly solve the same fundamental problems.

    Developer Experience: By handling foundational tasks and providing reusable assets, it allows developers to focus more on creating features that meet mission objectives


Building a product using a software factory involves the following activities:

    Problem analysis: Determines whether the product is in the scope of a software factory. The fit determines whether all or some of the product is built with the software factory.

    Product specification: Defines the product requirements by outlining the differences from the product line requirements using a range of product specification mechanisms.

    Product design: Maps the differences in requirements to differences in product line architecture and development process to produce a customized process.

    Product implementation: A range of mechanisms can be used to develop the implementation depending on the extent of the differences.

    Product deployment: Involves creating or reusing default deployment constraints and configuring the required resources necessary to install the executables being deployed.

    Product testing: Involves creating or reusing test assets (such as test cases, data sets, and scripts) and applying instrumentation and measurement tools.
